                                    <p>
                                        This week I have been finishing off writing my latest episode of <a href="../../podcast/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> about <strong>Good and Bad Developers</strong> and will be recording and editing it this weekend.
                                        It was also great to have stories from other developers too, but you will not really know which stories are based on my experiences, ones I know about or ones I was told,
                                        which makes it a bit more interesting! I've experienced many different things in my career and hope even the bad experiences of mine and others may help prevent those from happening to others and of course
                                        help encourage more good experiences!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Next week my talk <strong>How Sharing Can Make You A Better Developer</strong> will be available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScKslAgCZQE" target="_blank">YouTube</a> for <strong>Scottish Summit</strong>
                                        I will be talking about my path as a developer and how sharing helped shaped my journey from the very start to the present day including personal projects and professional career.
                                        It was great to have the opportunity to be able to do this talk as it didn't make it to the event itself, but will be great to head to Manchester next Friday for <strong>Scottish Summit</strong>
                                        on the Saturday and check out all the sessions that did make it!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I'm also going to be starting work on a brand-new talk about a couple of things that I think might be interesting for others to hear about, even if they didn't know anything about them in the first place,
                                        which will be about <strong>Zune</strong> and <strong>Windows Phone</strong>. I've already started to get some things together but this will be my most unique talk I have ever attempted,
                                        which I hope to deliver in the style of those talks where the person stands on stage and doesn't read from any speaker notes! I've done a little of that before for a few minutes but never a whole talk,
                                        but to become a better speaker and be able to do more events in that style is something I want to do, so I'm looking forward to the challenge!
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        This week's visit to <a href="https://makerspace.org.uk/" target="_blank">MakerSpace</a> this <strong>Welcome Wednesday</strong> was another chance to use my <strong>3D Printer</strong>,
                                        I first started by creating a print of <strong>Clippy</strong> or <strong>Clip-it</strong> as it was actually known and this printed well. I found a pop-out <strong>Space Shuttle</strong>
                                        that could be printed and made a start on this but while printing I noticed it seemed very thin, although it was to be a card that would be expected but this remained throughout the process.
                                        Once the print was completed it was clear that something had gone wrong, the plastic had become bundled up inside the part just before the extruder so no more plastic had come out,
                                        which is a known issue with a <strong>3D Printer</strong>, unfortunately there wasn't much time to resolve this so that will be my next task when I return in a couple of weeks! 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        It was great however to see many new people at <strong>MakerSpace</strong> who were checking it out for the very first time and potentially add more members was really great to see!
                                        There are people always working on their projects whether that is using a <strong>3D Printer</strong> or the computer-controlled lathe in the basement to precision cut pieces of wood,
                                        work on the soldering station to put together an electronic creation or so much more! There's something for everyone at <strong>MakerSpace</strong> so why not come along next <strong>Welcome Wednesday</strong>! 
                                    </p>

                                        It was great to be back at <a href="https://makerspace.org.uk/" target="_blank">MakerSpace</a> this <strong>Welcome Wednesday</strong> although what I tried to print on 
                                        my <strong>3D Printer</strong> didn't work out, but can read more about that in the post for that! While there I was starting to collect together some resources for 
                                        another talk that I have in mind along with reaching out to people about <strong>Zune</strong> and <strong>Windows Phone</strong>, can't say more than that but looking 
                                        forward to doing a different kind of talk!
                                    </p>

                                        This week I have been pulling together stories about good developers, bad developers along with some related stories for the latest <strong>Episode</strong> of 
                                        the <a href="../../podcast">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> about <strong>Good and Bad Developers</strong> which I'll be finishing off writing to then record and edit 
                                        this weekend! This also fits with an upcoming talk on <strong>YouTube</strong> for the <a href="https://scottishsummit.com" target="_blank">Scottish Summit</a> 
                                        about <strong>How sharing can make you a better Developer</strong>!                                        
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I've also been putting together some more content to celebrate twenty-five years of CESPage! The anniversary is coming up soon and it is great to be more active with posting 
                                        content online again much like I did back then, it was amazing to get hundreds of visitors with my most traffic ever being for an article I had written about playing a demo 
                                        of Halo 2 at an event, a lot of people were searching for that and it drew a lot of traffic my way, as did the Consumer Electronics Show for a while, but can probably guess 
                                        why that might have been. It has been interesting looking back and remix my old content for <strong>RoguePlanetoid.com</strong> and posting more often and is quite fitting 
                                        this is the twenty-fifth <strong>RoguePlanetoid Weekly Update</strong>!

                                        It was great to be back to <a href="https://makerspace.org.uk/" target="_blank">MakerSpace</a> this <strong>Welcome Wednesday</strong> as had been 
                                        a few weeks since my last visit as part of the <a href="../../articles/the-late-shows-20-may-2023/">Late Shows</a>! I decided to find a new 3D model 
                                        of a <strong>Zune</strong> to print using my <strong>3D Printer</strong> and found one that started printing well, but I had made a mistake in not 
                                        checking the model was 3D printable, it seemed it was a hollow model so when it was sliced it left the inside hollow too, so it printed the bottom 
                                        perfectly, but by the time it got to the top it tried printing the top in the air above the bottom!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Although printing using my <strong>3D Printer</strong> had gone wrong this time it was a great learning experience though and hopefully can get a model of a <strong>Zune</strong> I can 
                                        actually print, I was keen to get the one that was mentioned being printed in space to promote <strong>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</strong>!
                                        It was also a good chance to catch up with the people there and see what projects they were working on and start planning my next project at 
                                        <strong>MakerSpace</strong>, although while waiting for my <strong>3D Printer</strong> to finish I started putting together stuff for an up-coming presentation 
                                        I will be working on, which I'm really looking forward to! It is great to be able to go to <strong>MakerSpace</strong> and see everyone else 
                                        there and maybe will see someone new as you can always come along to a future <strong>Welcome Wednesday</strong>!

                                        It was great to appear on <a href="https://smartcherrysthoughts.com/" target="_blank">Smart Cherrys Thoughts</a> with <strong>Sai Charan Paloju</strong> 
                                        and their amazing and informative interview with me, they had interviewed many people I look up to, so it was great to be alongside them with my own interview.
                                        It was great to talk about my career, some of the things I have worked on and so much more. I'm delighted to have been able to have the opportunity to be in 
                                        interviewed and was a great experience!

                                        This week I attended the very first <a href="../../articles/northeast-coding-dojo-july-2023/">North East Coding Dojo</a> at <strong>Blackfriars</strong> in <strong>Newcastle-upon-Tyne</strong>.
                                        There were a couple of familiar faces, including someone I used to work with many years ago and was great to be able to catch up with them! We paired up and worked on a simple <strong>Fizzz Buzz</strong>
                                        example but applied the rules of Extreme Programming and Test-Driven Development or TDD and learn how you truly start out with tests first and wrote about my experiences in an <strong>Article</strong>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I will be putting together the next episode of the <a href="../../podcast/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> which will be about <strong>Good and Bad Developers</strong> where I'll
                                        share some stories from myself and fellow developers about some good developers they have learned from but also some about some bad developers too, so should be an interesting one,
                                        but the stories will have details changed so won't be the specific situations encountered both good or bad.

                                        Is great to post another <strong>RoguePlanetoid Weekly Update</strong> after a small haitus and getting back into things again with the sixth episode of
                                        <a href="../../podcast/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> which was about <a href="../../podcast/episode-six/">Blazor</a>! I actually wrote, recorded, edited and posted the <strong>Episode</strong>
                                        just a day before release, something I don't plan on doing again, which is ironic as the previous <strong>Episode</strong> about <a href="../podcast/episode-five/">Microsoft Build 2023</a>
                                        I thought was done at short notice but was actually completed earlier!
                                    </p>

                                        This week was <a href="https://www.thinkingdigital.co.uk" target="_blank">Thinking Digital</a> which comprised of the <a href="../articles/thinking-digital-2023-workshop/">10th Annual Start-up Competition</a>
                                        and the <a href="../../articles/thinking-digital-2023-conference/">Conference</a> itself and can read those <strong>Articles</strong> about. It was a real challenge writing those and getting them posted the same day,
                                        was amazing to see the <strong>Article</strong> about the Start-up competition featured in <a href="https://www.newcastletechdigest.co.uk/" target="_blank">Newcastle Tech Digest</a>!
                                        <strong>Thinking Digital</strong> was fantastic, and it was great to speak to the people I met both days, who I hope to see again, along with the amazing start-ups and speakers,
                                        both of which were interesting to hear from. I'm glad I decided to go along in person, and hopefully will make it along to next year!

                                        Some announcements of some upcoming appearances that I've not mentioned anywhere else, so you'll hear about it here first well before I announce it elsewhere!
                                        The first is I will be on <a href="https://dotnetcore.show/" target="_blank">The .NET Core Podcast</a> with <strong>Jamie Taylor</strong> who is an amazing developer and content creator,
                                        it was fantastic to be able to be a guest and can't wait to hear it when it is published! The second is I will be on <a href="https://smartcherrysthoughts.com/" target="_blank">Smart Cherrys Thoughts</a>
                                        by <strong>Sai Charan Paloju</strong> who was an amazing interviewer and asked me really great questions with hopefully really great answers! I'm hoping these opportunities will be the first of many
                                        more appearances on podcasts or videos by others!
