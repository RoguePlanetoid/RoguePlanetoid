                                      This week has been a really busy week with networking event by <strong>North East Network</strong> and <strong>Platform</strong> which I covered in my <strong>Article</strong> about it at 
                                      <a href="../../articles/platform-newcastle-aug-2024/">Platform Newcastle - August 2024</a> with some great insights and a show and tell with all 
                                      presentations being really interesting and glad this time it was just me listening but I did really enjoy last month's one where I got to present 
                                      about how we aim to help people get started in podcasting or help them on their podcasting journey with <a href="https://www.cluarantonn.com" target="_blank">Cluarantonn</a>
                                    </p>

                                      This week I've been doing a couple of things that have been keeping me busy that I can't say much about but along with those things I've been working 
                                      on the demo for the <strong>Presentation</strong> I'm working on which has been a great learning experience but good to be kept busy but always on the look out for new 
                                      things to work on, or companies I can work with in the <strong>.NET</strong> space so if you see anything like that then let me know, as it would be good to be able to pick 
                                      up some work to do alongside the other things I have been doing and can always check me out on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rogueplanetoid/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.

                                      Next week will be recording and editing the next <strong>Episode</strong> of the <a href="../../podcast/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> for September about 
                                      <strong>Windows 11 Widgets</strong>. It has turned out to be a really interesting experience learning about <strong>Widgets</strong> in <strong>Windows 11</strong> 
                                      and hopefully will get more people working with them although they can be a bit tricky, I did make it easier thanks to the updated version of my 
                                      <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Comentsys.Toolkit.WindowsAppSdk" target="_blank">Comentsys.Toolkit.WindowsAppSdk</a> package on <strong>NuGet</strong> 
                                      that I hope will encourage more <strong>Windows App SDK</strong> developers to take on the challenge and create <strong>Widgets</strong> of their own in <strong>Windows 11</strong>

                                      These past couple of weeks have been busy with some more new networking events to go along to such as the <strong>North East Network Pop Along</strong> 
                                      event and another studio tour for <a href="https://www.cluarantonn.com" target="_blank">Cluarantonn</a> including speaking to other businesses as part 
                                      of the <strong>PLMS</strong> group we recently joined which has been great to see how those in the group can help and how we can help them and there will be more conversations, tours and 
                                      networking next week too!
                                    </p>

                                      These last couple of weeks have been busy with working on a new presentation, <strong>Write Windows 11 Widgets with Windows App SDK</strong>, which is 
                                      something I've been doing for the past few weeks alongside the other things I was doing these past few weeks! Although not yet announced there are some 
                                      updated <strong>Packages</strong> on <a href="https://www.nuget.org" target="_blank">NuGet</a> that I've published including <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Comentsys.Toolkit" target="_blank">Comentsys.Toolkit</a> 
                                      with a <strong>1.1.0</strong> version which adds a helpful <strong>Class</strong> for <strong>Data Binding</strong> as well as some other small updates. 
                                      There is also a new <strong>2.0.0.</strong> version of <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Comentsys.Toolkit.WindowsAppSdk" target="_blank">Comentsys.Toolkit.WindowsAppSdk</a> 
                                      updated for <strong>.NET 8</strong> and addition of helper <strong>Classes</strong> developed by <strong>Microsoft</strong> for <strong>Widgets</strong> 
                                      in <strong>Windows 11</strong>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                      Next week there will be more things to do but also to continue with the new presentation, <strong>Write Windows 11 Widgets with Windows App SDK</strong>. 
                                      It is good to not only work on ways to help podcasters get started or help those who have a podcast already but continue creating as a software 
                                      developer, I'd never done <strong>Widgets</strong> before doing the short <strong>Talk</strong> on <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com/" target="_blank">tutorialr.com</a> 
                                      about <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com/talks/windows-app-sdk-with-dot-net/" target="_blank">Windows App SDK with .NET</a>. However now I've learned 
                                      more about them and made it easier for other developers to get started and the next <strong>Episode</strong> of the <a href="../../podcast/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> 
                                      in September will be about <strong>Windows 11 Widgets</strong>!

                                      This week didn't quite go to plan as wasn't feeling well for a couple of days which meant I missed the .NET Meetup in Newcastle which unfortunately wasn't recorded but 
                                      hopefully will get a chance to see <strong>John Staveley</strong> and <strong>Rob Boville</strong> present again in the future. I was able to make it to an online meetup 
                                      for a new group similar that connects businesses rather than just networking which was quite interesting and good to be able to still do online events as no matter how you 
                                      feel it is still possible to go along and get something out of those kind of events!

                                      This week was an opportunity to update <a href="https://wwww.creativeportfolio.info" target="_blank">creativeportfolio.info</a> with <strong>Work</strong> and 
                                      <strong>Personal</strong> experience, as last month saw me leave my previous job. So have updated it with the main things I had done there and an opportunity 
                                      to update a few other things there too. I look forward to the future which will not only include working on helping getting more people into podcasting 
                                      at <a href="https://www.cluarantonn.com" target="_blank">Cluarantonn</a> but also to see what new projects I'll be working on as a freelancer / contractor, 
                                      which is something I've been wanting to do for a long time and finally decided this is the time to do that, leveraging the skills and experience I've gained over the years!

                                      Next week will be an opportunity to return to putting together the presentation I mentioned that I'll hopefully be presenting at a local event as well as presenting at events 
                                      around the country. <a href="../../podcast/episode-nineteen/">Presenting</a> was the subject of the latest <strong>Episode</strong> of the <a href="../../podcast/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> 
                                      and was pleased to see how popular it was in the first day gaining the downloads I would expect after the first two weeks. I really do appreciate those taking the time to listen 
                                      as that helps make the hours of effort to write, record and edit the <strong>Podcast</strong> worthwhile. It was great to give tips and tricks that I hope will help others 
                                      in their presentations and look forward to seeing someone I've helped present something they are interested in or passionate about in the future!
