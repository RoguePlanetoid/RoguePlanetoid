                                  This week saw the <a href="../../articles/microsoft-ai-tour-london-2024/">Microsoft AI Tour London</a>  which I wrote an <strong>Article</strong> about for the Keynote, I missed 
                                  out both on the in-person event and digital event due to the late noticed about the event but glad was able to catch that, it was an amazing event last year and will hopefully 
                                  get to see the event in full next year if I can. There was also the <a href="../../articles/windows-dev-chat-oct-2024/">Windows Dev Chat</a> which I also covered with an 
                                  <strong>Article</strong> which is a great way of keeping everyone informed publicly, but have found the calls I get involved with as a 
                                  <strong>Microsoft MVP</strong> really interesting and informative but am unable to mention anything discussed until it has been made public!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  This week it was also great to go along to <strong>Silicon Mingle</strong> and see and speak to everyone there including catching up with familiar faces as well as meeting 
                                  some new people there too, it is always a really great event to go to and a good way of finding out what is going on, as well as be able to share what everyone is doing and 
                                  was great to see people who wished me well about the new job and our event last week. This week also marked fourteen years since <strong>Windows Phone 7</strong> was announced that had a 
                                  massive impact on my career as well as my personal life, I always think fondly of those times and it is thanks to <strong>Silicon Mingle</strong> I know there were many of us developing 
                                  for <strong>Windows Phone</strong> here in the North East I didn't know about at the time, so was great to know I wasn't alone up here after all thanks to that!

                                  Next week will see the release of the next <strong>Episode</strong> of the <a href="../../podcast/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> about <strong>ASP.NET Core</strong>. I have been 
                                  working with <strong>ASP.NET</strong> in one form or another for many years and has been the most common platform I've used as a professional developer, but for personal 
                                  projects is has always been mostly <strong>Windows Desktop</strong> development but I have at times been able to combine the two with some interesting applications of 
                                  technology supported in <strong>.NET</strong> and something I'd not yet covered on the <strong>Podcast</strong>, although I have covered 
                                  <a href="../../podcast/episode-six/">Blazor</a> before which I briefly cover again in this upcoming <strong>Episode</strong>!

                                <p class="blog-post-meta">21st October 2024</p>

                                <p>
                                  Today marks fourteen years since <strong>Windows Phone 7</strong> was released on October 21st here in the UK and other parts of the world. 
                                  It was amazing to go to a mobile phone shop as soon as it opened that day to pick up my very first <strong>Windows Phone</strong>, the <strong>HTC HD7</strong> which I had 
                                  been waiting for since it was announced. The first thing I did was install my app, <a href="https://www.zunecardr.com" target="_blank">ZuneCardr</a> 
                                  as I was lucky enough to be on the early access programme for developers and had one of the first thousand apps available for the platform at launch! 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  I had developed <strong>ZuneCardr</strong>, that brought the <strong>Zune Cards</strong> from <strong>Zune Social</strong> using just the emulator 
                                  mostly that came with the fantastic developer tools and experience so was able to get by, but there was a chance a few weeks before launch to travel 
                                  down to Manchester from the North East of England to try it out on a prototype Samsung Taylor device to see if my app worked fine, which it did with 
                                  just a couple of minor issues that I resolved and thankfully worked when I installed my app for the very first time fourteen years ago today!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  <strong>Windows Phone 7</strong> was an amazing platform, but of course it was not to be and it was very hard to compete with <strong>Android</strong> 
                                  and <strong>iOS</strong> which dominate then as they do now, but lots of innovations such as live tiles, much like today's widgets and always on 
                                  displays, wireless charging and high resolution cameras first appeared on Windows Phones, I owned many more handsets right up to the demise of 
                                  <strong>Windows Phone 7</strong>, it's successor <strong>Windows Phone 8</strong> and the newer <strong>Windows 10 Mobile</strong> that also didn't 
                                  make it, but was always proud to be a <strong>Windows Phone</strong> owner and developer plus it is wonderful to think of all the things that I did 
                                  thanks to that experience all those years ago!

                                  This week saw the first <strong>Workshop Wednesday</strong> on <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com" target="_blank">tutorialr.com</a> for while with the release of a 
                                  <strong>Workshop</strong> to create a <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com/workshops/windows-widget/" target="_blank">Windows Widget</a>. In this 
                                  <strong>Workshop</strong> you will learn how to create a customisable <strong>Countdown Widget</strong> where you can select from a set of types 
                                  that show an emoji that is used to set the colour scheme of the timer which can be a segment or matrix display along with the date, time and name 
                                  of the countdown. Hopefully this <strong>Workshop</strong> will act as a great introduction for many to get started building their own 
                                  <strong>Windows Widget</strong>.

                                  Next week I'll be making a start on my next project, which will be something that I hope will be of interest to many and help many on their developer journey, 
                                  and will be sharing more about it in the near future but am looking forward to the challenge of doing something new, but also that is inspired by the 
                                  many things I've done before and more recently!

                                  using <strong>Adaptive Cards</strong>.

                                <p>
                                  This week saw me start a new job at <a href="https://www.luminousxr.com" target="_blank">Luminous XR</a> as a <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong>! It is a great opportunity 
                                  to work on their web-based platform as well as get the chance to try out <strong>VR</strong> and <strong>AR</strong> experiences from time to time, it is still quite surreal to see people performing tasks in 
                                  <strong>VR</strong> but when you're doing it yourself it is really incredible, it was just my first week but hope to bring my experience as well as the chance to learn more things, and have 
                                  always been interested in that sector and pleased it is quite different to some of the sectors I have been in before.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  This week was also a chance to work on a new project which was a new <strong>Workshop</strong> for <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com" target="_blank">tutorialr.com</a> for a 
                                  <strong>Windows Widget</strong>, it is a chance to create your very own <strong>Countdown Widget</strong>, although there's one in <strong>Windows</strong> now, this one has a 
                                  fun look-and-feel using an <strong>Emoji</strong> to indicate the type of <strong>Countdown</strong>. It even uses the colour scheme from the <strong>Emoji</strong> and has the 
                                  potential to add more types of <strong>Countdown</strong> to extend upon the <strong>Workshop</strong> plus you can pick the <strong>Display</strong> to use from 
                                  either a <strong>Seven-Segment Display</strong> or <strong>Five-by-Seven Dot-Matrix Display</strong>. I have enjoyed putting together the <strong>Countdown Widget</strong> and 
                                  the <strong>Workshop</strong> and look forward to giving others the opportunity to learn how to put together their own <strong>Widget</strong> for <strong>Windows</strong>, 
                                  you'll be able to see and follow the <strong>Workshop</strong> for yourself this <strong>Workshop Wednesday</strong>!

                                  between 7pm and 9pm which is <strong>Podcast Paddock</strong> where you can saddle up for an evening of podcasting partnerships for new or existing podcasters, small business 
                                  owners and freelancers to gallop towards collaboration and growth! The horse related puns are due to the event being held at Haylofts in Newcastle upon Tyne, so if you're 
                                  free this Thursday to come along then you can sign up via <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/podcast-paddock-saddle-up-for-an-evening-of-podcasting-partnerships-tickets-1040025202377" target="_blank">Eventbrite</a>

                                  Last week was another busy week but this time working on a brand-new project, a new <strong>Workshop</strong> for <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com" target="_blank">tutorialr.com</a> 
                                  which I'll be releasing later this month. It will be great to have a <strong>Workshop Wednesday</strong> again as has been a couple of years since the last one but won't 
                                  hopefully be the last one for as long. This new <strong>Workshop</strong> will be about building your own <strong>Windows 11 Widget</strong>, I enjoyed putting together the 
                                  example for the Workshop and am hard at work writing it up now! I also released the latest episode of the <a href="../../podcast/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> about 
                                  <a href="../../podcast/episode-twenty-one">Microsoft MVP Award</a> where I talk about my journey to become a <strong>Microsoft MVP</strong> and aspire to inspire others to do the same.

                                <p>
                                  Last week saw updates to <strong>Packages</strong> including <strong>Comentsys.Toolkit</strong> which is one of my <a href="https://comentsys.com/packages/toolkits" target="_blank">Toolkits</a> where I added some 
                                  helpful methods for managing SVGs including Base-64 support plus updates to <strong>Packages</strong> for <a href="https://comentsys.com/packages/assets/" target="_blank">Assets</a> 
                                  including <strong>Comentsys.Assets.FluentIcons</strong> and <strong>Comentsys.Assets.FluentIcons.Filled</strong> where I added support for a method to get the <strong>Path Markup</strong> 
                                  for the Assets, which will allow them to be used on platforms that support this in <strong>XAML</strong> such as <strong>.NET MAUI</strong> and <strong>Uno Platform</strong>. 
                                  I also released a brand-new <strong>Packages</strong> of <a href="https://comentsys.com/packages/assets/" target="_blank">Assets</a> which was <strong>Comentsys.Assets.Display</strong> 
                                  which supports a <strong>Seven-Segment Display</strong> and <strong>Five-By-Seven Dot Matrix Display</strong>, this and the SVG functionality may form a part of that <strong>Workshop</strong>!

                                <p>
                                  This week will be one for a change, but it will help to do this and am looking forward to it and will share more about it next <strong>RoguePlanetoid Weekly Update</strong>, 
                                  but it has been great to work on so many different things recently and will continue to do so, even if it takes a bit longer to get there, I know I will but I'm also looking 
                                  forward to continue to work on the <strong>Workshop</strong> I have been developing and some updates to other things I have been doing too, along with other projects too!

                                  uses <strong>SVG</strong> or <strong>Scalable Vector Graphics</strong> for a <strong>Segment</strong> or <strong>Seven-Segment Display</strong> and <strong>Matrix</strong> or 
                                  <strong>Five-By-Seven Dot Matrix Display</strong>.

                                  It is great to release a brand new <strong>Assets</strong> package using <strong>.NET Standard 2.0</strong> that provides a <strong>Display</strong> using <strong>Segment</strong> and <strong>Matrix</strong>.
                                  This will allow applications using <strong>NET Standard</strong> to represent values from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>9</strong> along with <strong>:</strong> and <strong>-</strong>
                                  plus a <strong>Blank</strong> or <strong>Filled</strong> output for a <strong>Seven-Segment Display</strong> or <strong>Five-By-Seven Dot Matrix Display</strong>.

                                <p>
                                  Today sees the <strong>Release</strong> of version <strong>1.2.0</strong> of my <a href="https://comentsys.com/packages/toolkits/" target="_blank">Toolkit</a> of <strong>Comentsys.Toolkit</strong> for <strong>.NET Standard</strong> 
                                  on both <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Comentsys.Toolkit" target="_blank">NuGet</a> and open-source on 
                                  <a href="https://github.com/Comentsys/Comentsys.Toolkit" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. This <strong>Release</strong> adds more support for <strong>Asset Resources</strong> 
                                  including more methods to help implement third-party <strong>Asset Resources</strong> from a <strong>Stream</strong> or <strong>String</strong> along with <strong>Methods</strong> 
                                  for <strong>ToSvgString</strong> and <strong>ToBase64EncodedSvgString</strong> to allow an <strong>Asset Resource</strong> to be output them as an <strong>SVG</strong> including with <strong>Base-64 Encoding</strong>

                                <p>
                                  There was a <strong>1.2.0</strong> version but realised after releasing that <strong>GetBase64EncodedString</strong> helper <strong>Method</strong> may cause some confusion so this was updated
                                  so that it would only be visible to anything inheriting <strong>AssetBase</strong> for any third-party <strong>Asset Resources</strong> using the <strong>Comentsys.Toolkit</strong>.
                                  Being able to use <strong>Assets</strong> more easily was the main aim of this release and they can now be used across all existing <strong>Packages</strong> for <strong>Asset Resources</strong>.
