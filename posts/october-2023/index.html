                                    <p>
                                        Last week saw the release of <a href="https://dotnetcore.show/season-6/from-silverlight-to-windows-app-sdk-unleashing-the-power-of-windows-development-with-peter-bull/" target="_blank">S6E04 - From Silverlight to Windows App SDK: Unleashing the Power of Windows Development with Peter Bull</a>
                                        of the <a href="https://dotnetcore.show/" target="_blank">The Modern .NET Show</a> where I spoke about <strong>Windows App SDK</strong> with <strong>Jamie Taylor</strong>.
                                        I had been looking forward to the release of that and it came at the perfect time as <strong>WinUI 3</strong> was finally open sourced which has resulted in helping other platforms
                                        such as <strong>Uno Platform</strong> and even <strong>WPF</strong> gain more functionality thanks to that! Also, it seems the next version <strong>1.5</strong> of the <strong>Windows App SDK</strong> 
                                        may finally add the InkCanvas control which I mentioned in the episode so am looking forward to that being added! The most amazing outcome from being on the show has been an unprecedented increase
                                        in downloads for the <a href="../../podcast/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a>, where I have doubled the downloads of many <strong>Episodes</strong>! I really appreciate everyone who has taken the time to listen,
                                        I may have expected to odd extra download but nothing like that, many thanks to you all for the support!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This week I was at <strong>The Big North East Tech Social</strong> which combined <strong>Ignite</strong> and <strong>Silicon Mingle</strong>, it was amazing to see so many different parts of the North East tech community come together!
                                        It was also a great chance to meet up again with many I'd seen at the last <strong>Silicon Mingle</strong>, some other familiar faces and even people I'd not seen for years! I'm so pleased to see how vibrant the community is again and may
                                        be the best it has ever been since another event ended many years ago! Talking of that event last week I went along to the reunion dinner for <strong>SuperMondays</strong> and was great to see people there I still knew from then and others
                                        I'd not seen since it ended, that event was my first ever event of any kind and without that I would not be where I am today! There will be an upcoming event 
                                        <a href="https://www.supermondays.org/2023/10/24/the-super-mondays-reunion-2023/" target="_blank">The Super Mondays Reunion 2023</a> where many people there including myself will say what they've done since the 
                                        <strong>SuperMondays</strong> ended, so am really looking forward to that!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This week I was at a brand new event <a href="../../articles/haystack-live-october-2023/">Haystack Live</a> with talks from <strong>James Sherwood-Jones</strong>, <strong>Andrew Waters</strong>
                                        and <strong>Dylan McKee</strong>. It was a really great event and really well attended, some had been at <strong>The Big North East Tech Social</strong> but also many more I was able to catch up 
                                        with or meet for the first time, the event was very well organised and there was plenty of free merch on offer! It is great to have seen so many new events start this year in the North East of England,
                                        when down in London I mentioned that more events should come up here and see what is going on, there's probably never been a better time to be in the region as a business or as an event,
                                        and it is great to see that increase more and more just throughout this year alone!

                                    <p>
                                        This week I was down in London for <a href="../../articles/microsoft-build-ai-day/">Microsoft Build AI Day</a> and another one I found out about a few 
                                        days before which was <a href="../../articles/microsoft-envision-the-tour-london/">Microsoft Envision - The Tour London</a> and can read <strong>Articles</strong> 
                                        about them both. I managed to catch the last session of the day for Microsoft Envision - The Tour London and it was fantastic to see Satya Nadella who
                                        I'd not seen speak in person since I first saw him on stage during Microsoft Build 2012 when I thought he'd be in for a chance at being the new CEO when 
                                        Steve Ballmer stepped down and turned out to be correct! It was amazing to hear how even as a chief executive of a company that AI was making his job easier,
                                        and freeing him up to do more things, and how it will impact each and every person the planet. Microsoft's mission is to empower every person and every 
                                        organisation on the planet to achieve more and AI looks like the best and fastest way to achieve that goal. Steven Bartlett followed who is well known for 
                                        being one the Dragons on Dragon's Den along with many other things including his popular podcast "Diary of a CEO", it was amazing to hear him speak,
                                        one of the best speakers I've ever heard from and was so informative, inspiring, and interesting to listen to and plenty of useful insights made me pleased 
                                        I was able to make that last session!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This week was dominated by my visit to <a href="../../articles/microsoft-build-ai-day/">Microsoft Build AI Day</a>, and from the very start where I was lucky enough to get to the front row and watch 
                                        Scott Hanselman's opening keynote which was fantastic and is such an amazing speaker and was great to be able to learn so much about speaking along 
                                        with developing with AI from his session. It was also great to see Amy and Joylynn join Scott on stage which added even more detail to the talk,
                                        it was amazing to watch and a great way to kick off the event! There were sessions from Henk Boelman about getting started with generative AI using 
                                        the Azure Open AI service, getting the most out of GitHub Copilot by Chris Reddington and a really informative talk from Seth Juarez who made it 
                                        really easy to understand what generative AI really is, which was great and wasn't too overwhelming! There was also a workshop on using GitHub Copilot 
                                        which means I now have a two-week trial to try it out more so will do that! It was also great to speak to those there including on the stands and with 
                                        fellow attendees all of whom I hope to catch up with again in the future, it was amazing to come down from Gateshead to London and learn more about 
                                        developing with AI and bring that back home!

                                        This week also saw the release of <a href="https://dotnetcore.show/season-6/from-silverlight-to-windows-app-sdk-unleashing-the-power-of-windows-development-with-peter-bull/" target="_blank">S6E04 - From Silverlight to Windows App SDK: Unleashing the Power of Windows Development with Peter Bull</a>
                                        of the <a href="https://dotnetcore.show/" target="_blank">The Modern .NET Show</a> where I spoke about <strong>Windows App SDK</strong> along with the various technologies I've used
                                        to develop with on Windows! It was amazing to be on the show and record with <strong>Jamie Taylor</strong>, he was really helpful in sharing advice and improvements for the <a href="../../podcast/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a>
                                        which I really appreciated and made a big difference - it sounds much better now! I really enjoyed talking about my experiences as a developer and have been looking forward to the episode
                                        coming out for a while but it was great to see the episode finally released! I'm looking forward to being on more podcasts in the future, so if you want to have a chat with me then let me know,
                                        also if you want to be on mine then you can also do the same! You can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rogueplanetoid/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and message me there!

                                        This week I did my talk <strong>Blazor a trail with .NET 8</strong> at <a href="https://www.devhubnorth.com/" target="_blank">DevHub North</a> where 
                                        I joined <strong>Gary Brown</strong> from <strong>AND Digital</strong> talking about <strong>Agile IT Architecture Design: Building Efficient and 
                                        Effective Systems for AWS and Beyond</strong>. It was an amazing experience, I had put together great slides along with an interesting and fun demo 
                                        but doing the talk itself was the best part! I think it was the best talk I'd ever done and seemed many of those there also really enjoyed the talk,
                                        also the other talk was really interesting and informative so was pleased to see another great talk along with everyone else! If you missed out, or
                                        want to read about them then you can with my <strong>Article</strong> about <a href="../articles/dev-hub-north-october-2023/">DevHub North - October 2023</a>!

                                        This week also saw some big <strong>Microsoft</strong> news of <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/10/13/xbox-activision-blizzard" target="_blank">Activision Blizzard King joins Xbox</a>!
                                        That completes the $69 billon dollar merger, the largest ever done by <strong>Microsoft</strong> but also ensures than many titles not on <strong>Xbox</strong> will remain on those platforms,
                                        but also means a strong portfolio of current and potential games coming to <strong>Xbox</strong>! I enjoy playing games myself sometimes, such as the recently released <strong>Starfield</strong>,
                                        so it will be interesting to see what this deal means for gamers in the long term, but for now it is great to see this deal close! It is especially great to see this as the last hurdle was overcoming 
                                        my own country's <strong>Competition and Markets Authority</strong>, but was pleased that they finally gave the go ahead which allowed the deal to be completed!                                        
                                    </p>

                                        Next week I'll be at <strong>Microsoft Build: AI Day</strong> in <strong>London</strong>, speakers include <strong>Scott Hanselman</strong>, <strong>Amy Boyd</strong>, <strong>Anthony Shaw</strong>,
                                        <strong>Burke Holland</strong>, <strong>Chris Reddington</strong>, <strong>Henk Boelman</strong>, <strong>Joylynn Kirui</strong>, <strong>Liam Hampton</strong>, <strong>Paul Yu</strong>,
                                        <strong>Steven Murawski</strong>, <strong>Seth Juarez</strong> and <strong>Dona Sarkar</strong>. It will be amazing to see the speakers there as many of them I've only seen on live streams,
                                        so it will be great to see them in person, and hopefully say hello if they're not too busy! Also it will be great to see and meet any fellow attendees and learn about using AI as a developer,
                                        something I'm keen to learn more about! You can still register for <a href="https://msevents.microsoft.com/event?id=3925877575" target="_blank">Microsoft Build: AI Day</a> along with finding out 
                                        more about the day, and for anyone there then feel free to say hello, will be great to see you! I'll be travelling down to <strong>London</strong> the day before so if you're there too am happy to 
                                        meet up and talk about AI together!

                                        This week it was great to be able to write, record and edit the <strong>Episode</strong> about <a href="../../podcast/episode-nine/">.NET 8</a> for the <a href="../../podcast/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a>!
                                        <strong>.NET 8</strong> will be the latest version of .NET with enhanced app building experience with easy container creation, cross-platform versatility, improved Linux support, and secure supply chain capabilities.

                                        Next week I'll be doing my talk <strong>Blazor a trail with .NET 8</strong> at <a href="https://www.devhubnorth.com/" target="_blank">DevHub North</a> which will be joining another talk 
                                        <strong>Agile IT Architecture Design: Building Efficient and Effective Systems for AWS and Beyond</strong> by <strong>Gary Brown</strong> from <strong>AND Digital</strong>. 
                                        If you want to come along then the event will be at <strong>TusPark</strong> in Newcastle upon Tyne on the 10th of October from 5:30pm and can sign up via
                                        <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/devhub-north-october-meetup-tickets-728285029127" target="_blank">DevHub North - October Meetup</a>. I'll be showing off new features of <strong>.NET 8</strong>,
                                        <strong>C# 12</strong> and <strong>Blazor</strong> plus a demo app that I've put together especially for the talk!

                                        Next week I'll be finishing off the other talk I had been putting together about <strong>Zune</strong> and <strong>Windows Phone</strong> and hopefully be able to do that in the near future,
                                        it has been really fun to put that together and am not only hoping to do the talk without reading too much from speaker notes but I'll also have something things to show off related to the talk.
                                        That talk is going to be a real challenge for me, but my aim is to improve my skills as a speaker so I can do even more events in the future and hopefully represent developers from and living in the 
                                        North East of England at talks around the country and maybe even further afield in the future!
