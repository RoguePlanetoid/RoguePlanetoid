                                <p>
                                  Last week it was amazing to be at the <a href="../../articles/tremula-festival-2024/">Tremula Festival</a> which was a celebration of audio storytelling, outdoors, nature 
                                  and community along with attending <a href="../../articles/crimecon-london-2024/">CrimeCon London 2024</a> where I helped represent the Scottish Murders podcast. Both events 
                                  were interesting and informative and learned so much from them with plenty of new people to speak to and meet as well as catch up with a few familiar faces along with Writing
                                  an <strong>Article</strong> about both events.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  Last week after getting back from the events it was good to start working on part of a new project as well as thinking about another new project - both of which will help people 
                                  learn new things or get them started so will be great to work on those and will share more details when I can. This month has been amazing after receiving the 
                                  <strong>Microsoft MVP Award</strong> at the start of the month which included doing my first presentation as a <strong>Microsoft MVP </strong>at the 
                                  <a href="../../articles/dot-net-meetup-newcastle-sep-2024">Qudos .NET Meetup in Newcastle</a> talking about <strong>Windows 11 Widgets</strong> where I joined 
                                  <strong>Andy Morrell</strong> who talked about <strong>ADHD in a Software Development Environment</strong>. Not only did I cover these with an 
                                  <strong>Article</strong> but there is also now a Video on  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dp3c3wEh5g" target="_blank">YouTube</a> if you want to watch my 
                                  talk there!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  Next week will see the next <strong>Episode</strong> of the <a href="../../podcast/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> about the <strong>Microsoft MVP Award</strong> where I talk about 
                                  my journey as a software developer as there's not much I can share about my experiences of the programme itself but hope my journey and experiences will help inspire others 
                                  to aspire to do the same. <strong>Talking</strong> of <strong>Inspiration</strong>, I also mention briefly my new upcoming project which I'll be sharing soon along with slipping in a reference to something 
                                  from an upcoming project I have been helping with which I also can't wait to talk about soon too!

                                  Last week was another busy week with more work on a project I've been helping with which I'm looking forward to talking more about in the future, 
                                  but it has been an interesting experience to be part of so far and can't wait to share more about it when I can. Also, the excitement of becoming 
                                  a <a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/MVP/profile/cd2d732e-bf43-42ad-8827-da07165b1218" target="_blank">Microsoft MVP</a> hasn't faded and 
                                  still catch myself smiling to myself when I see the trophy on my shelves, and it is thanks to the community it is there and look forward to doing 
                                  more for the community in return!

                                  Last week I've been working away on my new presentation, <strong>Writing Windows 11 Widgets</strong>, which will be at the 
                                  <strong>.NET Meetup - Newcastle</strong> later this month on the 24th of September at BJSS in Newcastle upon Tyne. I'm really 
                                  looking forward to my first talk as a <strong>Microsoft MVP</strong> and joining <strong>Andy Morell</strong> who will be 
                                  talking about <strong>ADHD in a Development Environment</strong> so it should be an interesting event and if you can join us

                                  This week will be another busy one where I'll be working on yet another project which will be a brand-new <strong>Podcast</strong> and look forward 
                                  to sharing more about that very soon! Podcasting will also be the theme later this week when I will be heading down to Brighton for an event about 
                                  outdoor podcasting followed by <a href="https://www.crimecon.co.uk/" target="_blank">Crimecon</a> where I'll be representing

                                  There won't be a weekly update this weekend due to attending these events but look forward to getting back into things here and my own projects 
                                  again when I get back!

                                <p class="blog-post-meta">9th September 2024</p>

                                <p>
                                  I was proud and honoured to have become a Microsoft MVP for .NET and Windows Development at the start of this month recognising my contributions to the technical community, 
                                  which has been helped by those in the community and my now fellow MVPs which is much appreciated! Today I received the MVP Award itself, which was amazing to unbox and put 
                                  on my shelf this morning, as I've never received a physical award before, the closest I've ever come was an award at my high school where I came second to winning for efforts 
                                  and achievements. However, the person who won that award was a friend of mind who deserved it so very much more, they helped spur me on and put me on the road to further 
                                  achievements in my life which resulted in many opportunities and experiences with the most recent of which becoming a Microsoft MVP!

                                  I've caught myself looking at the award on my shelf a few times today, something I've only seen in photos I've liked on social media from other or previous recipients, 
                                  which has always and remains a fantastic thing to see and is amazing to see people grow and receive their email that they have become a Microsoft MVP and been so pleased 
                                  to have become one myself. I'll always remember this time as I gaze at that award and use it to spur me on more to help inspire others who may one day achieve their own 
                                  goals in the community and get their email and put an award on their own shelf as they join me in becoming a Microsoft MVP!

                                  Last week was an incredible week when I found out I'd received the <strong>MVP Award</strong> for <strong>.NET</strong> and <strong>Windows Development</strong> and it 
                                  is great to see my <a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/MVP/profile/cd2d732e-bf43-42ad-8827-da07165b1218" target="_blank">Profile</a> on their website! It has been 
                                  something I've always wanted to achieve as I've looked up to those in the <strong>MVP</strong> community as they have helped inspire me and get me where I am today and 
                                  am grateful for the opportunity to become one myself and help inspire others as I was inspired. I'm looking forward to doing so much more for the community and appreciate 
                                  all the help and support that has got me where I am today and proud to help and support others.

                                  This week I'll be working on some existing projects along with a <strong>Writing Windows 11 Widgets</strong> presentation I'll be presenting later this month which will be my 
                                  first as a <strong>Microsoft MVP</strong>! It will also be great to keep up the momentum from last week with plenty of things to work on along with new things, it has been a 
                                  great month so far and we're just a week into September!

                                </p>

                                  It is great to get these <strong>Assets</strong> packages updated which included some fixes to the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-emoji" target="_blank">Microsoft Fluent Emoji</a> 
                                  that were needed to the packages using those. There was a rather disappointing looking <strong>Pile of Poo</strong> emoji that almost resulted in the updates being referred to 
                                  as such but there were a few other changes that meant that the updates could just refer to Emoji Fixes, but it would have been rather amusing to have used that name! There 
                                  hadn't been too many fixes to the <strong>Microsoft Fluent Emoji</strong> since the original <strong>Comentsys.Assets.FluentEmoji.*</strong> packages were released two years ago 
                                  but it was good to get many of those fixes into the packages using those <strong>Assets</strong>.

                                  This week was great to make some progress with some upcoming projects, one of which is a new <strong>Podcast</strong> I'm working on which I'll be sharing more details about 
                                  soon. I also went along to the <strong>Silicon Summer</strong> event for <strong>Silicon Mingle</strong> which was a great opportunity to catch up with people, many I hadn't 
                                  seen in a while as well as meet some new people and talk about how am helping new and existing podcasters with <a href="https://www.cluarantonn.com/" target="_blank">Cluarantonn</a>. 
                                  There was also a chance the following morning to go along to another <strong>The Mussel Club</strong> event and make some new connections, it is great to get out and meet so 
                                  many amazing people and find out about all the things they are doing too. It is fantastic to not only be part of an amazing Tech Scene in the North East of England but be also 
                                  part of the wider small business community here.

                                  This week ended with some amazing news which I've also posted about which was being awarded the <strong>Microsoft MVP Award</strong> for <strong>.NET</strong> and 
                                  <strong>Windows Development</strong> in recognition of the hard work I've been doing and will continue to do for the developer community not just here in the 
                                  North East of England but also in the wider community too, so was a fantastic way to end the week. <a href="../../podcast/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> also saw the release 
                                  of the latest <strong>Episode</strong> about <a href="../../podcast/episode-twenty">Windows 11 Widgets</a> which I have been learning about for the past few weeks and hope 
                                  to speak about at an event in the future too, especially as I can now add after my name that I'm a <strong>Microsoft MVP</strong>.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  Next week I'll be continuing some projects I'm working on and to built upon the things I've been doing and the recognition becoming a <strong>Microsoft MVP</strong> as well 
                                  as planning ahead for a few things I'll be doing or learning this month, so there's still plenty of work to be done but with this month already off to an amazing start and 
                                  if it continues like it has started it will be an superb September!

                                  didn't even take into account this newly updated package, but is my way of helping <strong>Windows App SDK</strong> developers using <strong>.NET</strong> everywhere who

                                  Today it was fantastic to see that I had received the <strong>MVP (Most Valuable Professional Award)</strong> from <strong>Microsoft</strong> for <strong>.NET</strong> 
                                  and <strong>Windows Development</strong>. The <strong>MVP Award</strong> is there to recognise the exceptional contributions from those in the <strong>Microsoft</strong> technical 
                                  community for their expertise, leadership, speaking experience, influence and commitment to solving issues that impact people in their lives. I am both honoured and 
                                  humbled to have received this award today and become a <strong>Microsoft MVP</strong>!

                                  I've been a software developer for over thirty years starting out on my <strong>Commodore 64</strong> coding in <strong>BASIC</strong>, then moving more toward the 
                                  <strong>Microsoft</strong> ecosystem with <strong>Visual Basic 6</strong> before finally witnessing the arrival of <strong>.NET</strong> with the original <strong>.NET Framework</strong> which I have 
                                  witnessed grow from its roots to the modern <strong>.NET</strong> it is today which has included over twenty years of professional experience as a developer first using 
                                  <strong>VB.NET</strong> and mostly to now using <strong>C#</strong>.

                                  I've seen platforms come and go that use <strong>.NET</strong> but always been willing to share what I know from day one with tutorials or help people get started or progress in their careers 
                                  or get interested in development with my workshops. I've also shared what I know over the years with my presentations which now next to my name can put that I am a 
                                  <strong>Microsoft MVP</strong>!
