                                      This week I decided to change what I was working on to a long-form <strong>Presentation</strong> that I'll hopefully be able to present in the future. I will be looking 
                                      at doing more <strong>Talks</strong> for <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com" target="_blank">tutorialr.com</a> with another three covering <strong>.NET MAUI</strong> & <strong>Uno Platform</strong> 
                                      along with <strong>Blazor</strong> and an updated one about <strong>Spotify for Developers</strong>. Later this year will be working on more <strong>Tutorials</strong> for 
                                      <strong>Windows App SDK</strong> so there's still plenty of things to add there along with creating that new <strong>Presentation</strong>!
                                    </p>                    
                                    <p>
                                      This week I was at <a href="https://www.siliconmingle.com" target="_blank">Silicon Mingle</a>, which I also wrote an <a href="../../articles/silicon-mingle">Article</a> about, 
                                      which was another great opportunity to catch up with many people I know from previous events as well as meeting new people. It is great to see an event like this in the 
                                      North East of England as there was a great need for an event like this not just from those organising it but also those attending such as myself. 
                                      I also attended <a href="https://www.themusselclub.com/" target="_blank">The Mussel Club</a>, which also included writing an <a href="../../articles/the-mussel-club/">Article</a> 
                                      about it, which is a networking event for businesses in the North East of England. It is great to be able to add new events to the tech events I had been attending and hope 
                                      to go along to many more in the future!

                                      Next week I will be at <strong>.NET Meetup - Newcastle</strong> with talks by <strong>John Staveley</strong> on <strong>Demystifying gRPC</strong> and <strong>Rob Boville</strong> 
                                      on <strong>Hyperscale SaaS Solutions, AI Implementations</strong>. I'm looking forward to going along and hearing from both talks there as it is always great to see people 
                                      presenting as well as present talks myself. The next <strong>Episode</strong> of the <a href="../../podcast">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> will be about <strong>Presenting</strong> 
                                      where I talk about my introduction and some of my journey with presenting as well as some useful tips that will hopefully help and encourage the next generation of speakers 
                                      I hope to see at an event in the future presenting about a topic that interests them and informs me.

                                      This week I was visited the <strong>Podcast Studio</strong> at <a href="https://flok.life" target="_blank">Flok Co-working Space</a> in Middlesbrough. It was a great 
                                      opportunity to have a look around and have a tour of the place and would like to thank Danni for taking the time to show us around which helped with putting together 
                                      information for anyone, including myself, who will be using the Podcast Studio in the future!

                                      This week was also a chance to go along to the <a href="../../articles/platform-july-2024/">Platform</a> event this month in Newcastle, not only to see people speak there 
                                      and write an <strong>Article</strong> about the event, but also to be amongst them talking about <a href="https://www.cluarantonn.com" target="_blank">Cluarantonn</a> 
                                      where we aim to build a community to support new and existing podcasters and connect them with small businesses and freelancers to help them where needed. 
                                      It was a great opportunity to speak and my very first presentation where I didn't use any notes whatsoever as I'd been looking forward to the chance to be able to 
                                      do that and was great that it was doing that to pitch our new business.

                                      published on 1st August, but this week it was also great to see mention of the latest <strong>Episode</strong> about the <a href="../../podcast/episode-eighteen/">North East Tech Scene</a> 
                                      in the <a href="https://newcastletechdigest.substack.com/ " target="_blank">Newcastle Tech Digest</a>. I'll be able to make more progress with the next <strong>Talk</strong>

                                      as well as the webinar to find out about Newcastle's new 5G Innovation Lab which will be opening soon and of course wrote an <strong>Article</strong> about 
                                      both events.

                                      This week was also a chance to look into a few things for the future as well as a chance to fully recover from not being well the past few weeks but pleased to 
                                      be back to normal so can then prepare for some up coming things I'll either be involved with or working on this month.

                                      Next week I'll be at <strong>Platform</strong> in Newcastle on Friday where I'll be talking about <a href="https://www.cluarantonn.com" target="_blank">Cluarantonn</a> which helps people get started with podcasting, helps them on their 
                                      journey as well as getting them support from small businesses or freelancers. I'll also aim to continue the upcoming next Talk for 
                                      <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com" target="_blank">tutorialr.com</a> about <strong>.NET MAUI</strong> and <strong>Uno Platform</strong>.

                                      It is great to reach the sixtieth <strong>Weekly Update</strong> but the last couple of weeks didn't quite turn out as expected as was not 
                                      feeling well so ended up not doing anything that I planned on doing that week and the previous week which included releasing 
                                      this month's <strong>Episode</strong> of the <a href="../../podcast/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> on time for the very first time 
                                      as my voice just wasn't up to it! However, last week has been an opportunity to rest and recuperate instead so was ready for 
                                      this week where I could tackle many of the things I had to put off!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                      This week I was able to record the latest <strong>Episode</strong> of the <a href="../../podcast/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> about the 
                                      <a href="../../podcast/episode-eighteen/">North East Tech Scene</a> as I had recovered enough to do it and didn't want people waiting too long, 
                                      but you can probably hear my voice isn't quite the same as usual in a few places but it is still nice and clear to listen to! It was great to 
                                      speak about the history of the region with a few historical facts about lightbulbs, bridges over the River Tyne and my being one of the first 
                                      people on the Tyne and Wear Metro when I just was a few months old - I wasn't able to be in my pram as those weren't allowed on at the time but 
                                      many parents were able to campaign against it, so it was left in the station but was safe and sound for my return when we got back.

                                      Next week will be good to get back to normal and get along to events again, I had to miss so many events after <strong>TechNExt</strong> I would 
                                      have been able to get along to so will be good to go along to some this month. I'll make a start on the next <strong>Talk</strong> for 
                                      <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com" target="_blank">tutorialr.com</a> which will cover <strong>.NET MAUI</strong> and <strong>Uno Platform</strong> 
                                      along with continuing something I can't talk about just yet but looking forward to the future and putting myself first and making sure that I find 
                                      the right things for me and continue to do the things I'm passionate about and share what I can with the community and share what is going on in 
                                      the community when I can too.
