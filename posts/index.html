                                        This week saw the very first <a href="https://www.meetup.com/dev-community-north-east/" target="_blank">Dev Community North East</a> held in Durham and was one of the speakers
                                        where I spoke in a short talk about my experiences at <strong>Bede Gaming</strong> along with some of the challenges we face and my thoughts about the region, it was amazing with a fantastic
                                        turnout and the other speakers were so great too, I've actually never done a talk where I wasn't directly in front of my computer, I really enjoyed that style and hopefully will
                                        do that again in the future! It is fantastic to see new user groups forming and old ones thriving again and to give my first talk of the year, you can read all about the talks
                                        in my <a href="../articles/dev-community-ne-march-2023/">Article</a>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>AI</strong> this year is the next big thing in the tech sector, not only something I've covered here about what <strong>Microsoft</strong> is doing, 
                                        which has been added to in the past week with <a href="../articles/microsoft-loop/">Microsoft Loop</a> which is designed for co-creation and features <strong>Microsoft 365 Copilot</strong>
                                        along with <strong>GitHub Copilot X</strong> which is the next-generation of AI assistance to developers. Also other companies such as <strong>Adobe</strong>
                                        are adding AI to their products with <strong>Adobe Firefly</strong> which can help generate images, audio, videos and more in their products.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Next week, on Tuesday 28th March, I'll be presenting my first full-length <strong>Presentation</strong> this year at <a href="https://ne-bytes.github.io/">NEBytes</a> online about <strong>Microsoft & AI</strong> alongside 
                                        <strong>Ian Douglas</strong> who will be speaking about <strong>How to move from Manual Testing to Automated Testing with Postman</strong>. There's been a few new things added forming
                                        <strong>Microsoft</strong> regarding AI that if I'd done it last month it would already be out of date, also the next <strong>Episode</strong> of my <strong>Podcast</strong> 
                                        will need a few additions before it gets released next week as things have changed in the week since it was recorded!

                                        original GitHub Copilot which was built using the Codex Model from OpenAI which has evolved to become a new GPT-4 powered experience 
                                        along with chat and voice plus bringing it to pull requests, command line and documentation to help answer questions on your projects.
                                        It refines what it means to be a productive developer, by reducing boilerplate and manual tasks and making complicated work even 
                                        easier in every part of the development lifecycle and enable developers to focus on the bigger picture.

                                        in-depth analysis and explanations of what code blocks are doing along with helping to generate unit tests and propose fixes for bugs in the code. 
                                        ull Requests are enhanced with AI-powered tags and suggestions for pull request descriptions which can then be reviewed or modified along with 
                                        warning developers test coverage is not sufficient and suggest additional tests which can then be edited, accepted or rejected depending 
                                        on the needs of the project. It also can provide AI-generated answers about documentation which includes questions developers have about any languages, 
                                        frameworks and technologies being used in a project which includes documentation for React, Azure and MDN.

                                        This week I attended my very first <strong>DevOps North East</strong> in association with <strong>Tech on the Tyne</strong> about <a href="../articles/devops-north-east-mar-2023/">Self-Service Cloud Infrastructure and GitOps</a> 
                                        which was quite interesting and also the first time I've published an <strong>Article</strong> within minutes of the event finishing, will be a challenge to beat that, but it was an interesting session and good to
                                        add another user group that I've visited to the list!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This week saw the announcement of <a href="../articles/microsoft-365-copilot/">Microsoft 365 Copilot</a> which is an amazing AI-powered experience that makes it easy to use <strong>Word</strong>,
                                        <strong>Excel</strong>, <strong>PowerPoint</strong>, <strong>Outlook</strong>, <strong>Teams</strong> and more with natural language, it was incredible to see the demos and am looking forward to 
                                        the opportunity to be able to use it for myself when it gets wider availability.

                                        This week also saw a brand-refresh for the <strong>Podcast</strong> which I'm very pleased with and will be writing and recording the next episode soon which will be able <strong>Microsoft & AI</strong>
                                        and I also signed up for <strong>Microsoft Build</strong> which is going to be <strong>Online</strong> and in <strong>Seattle</strong>, although I'm not going in person will be doing the <strong>Online</strong> event,
                                        which I'm sure will be really interesting and informative. Next week I'll be doing a talk during the very first very first <a href="https://www.meetup.com/dev-community-north-east/events/291932974/" target="_blank">Dev Community North East</a> 
                                        event in Durham where I'll be talking about <strong>Bede Gaming</strong>.

                                        <a hef="https://build.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft Build 2023</a> is open for <strong>Registration</strong> it will be held both online May 23rd - 24th 2023 
                                        and in person with an optional pre-day workshop May 22nd - 25th 2023 in <strong>Seattle</strong>. I've signed up for the online version of the event as the past few years have
                                        been amazing, I even appeared in a small community session at <strong>Microsoft Build 2022</strong> last year!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        If you get a chance to go in person though, <strong>Seattle</strong> is an amazing city, I went there for <strong>Microsoft Build 2012</strong> and it was incredible seeing all the sights around the city
                                        before the conference, then the conference itself was amazing to be able to meet and speak to so many people in person from <strong>Microsoft</strong> was fantastic.
                                        You can also check out the <strong>Museum of Flight</strong> or take a trip further afield to the <strong>Boeing Factory</strong> which is incredible!

                                        I've refreshed the <a href="../podcast/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> logo to better represent a <strong>Podcast</strong> with a headphones inspired logo, 
                                        this replaces the original abstract logo and am a lot happier with this version. There will be also updated social and related graphics that will be used 
                                        for the next <strong>Episode</strong> which will be about <strong>Microsoft & AI</strong> so remember to check it out on April 1st 2023!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There's only been a few downloads so far for the <strong>Podcast</strong> but know that more people will listen to it in the future, and just like the brand
                                        refresh I know I can improve on it each <strong>Episode</strong> along with having guests in the future, if you have any feedback then you can use
                                        <a href="https://www.twitter.com/rogueplanetoid" target="_blank">Twitter</a> to contact me with any suggestions, ideas, guests or if you want to appear on the <strong>Podcast</strong> too.

                                        If you're wondering why things have been a bit quieter this month, I've been putting together my <strong>Presentation</strong> for <a href="https://ne-bytes.github.io/" target="_blank">NE Bytes</a> later this month about <strong>Microsoft & AI</strong>
                                        I'll also be doing a talk for the very first <a href="https://www.meetup.com/dev-community-north-east/events/291932974/" target="_blank">Dev Community North East</a> event in Durham where I'll be talking about <strong>Bede Gaming</strong>
                                        along with some of my experiences along the way here in the <strong>North East</strong> so will be great to put together that short talk this month too!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I'll be doing a brand refresh of the <strong>RoguePlanetoid Podcast</strong> now that <strong>Anchor</strong> has become <strong>Spotify for Podcasters</strong> so would need update them anyway!
                                        I'm looking forward to being able to create something that looks a bit better for those, also thanks to anyone who has been listening to the <strong>RoguePlanetoid Podcast</strong> so far and will be writing the next episode which will
                                        be about <strong>Microsoft & AI</strong> where I'll go into a bit more depth on a few points from my <strong>Presentation</strong>.
                                    </p>

                                        I'm aiming to publish more <strong>Articles</strong> this year about a variety of things along with talking about things on the <strong>Podcast</strong>, so if there's anything you'd like me to take a look at
                                        or want to talk to me or suggest and idea for an <strong>Article</strong> or a <strong>Podcast</strong> then let me know via <strong>Twitter</strong> at <a href="https://www.twitter.com/rogueplanetoid" target="_blank">@RoguePlanetoid</a>.
                                        Will be great to be able to engage more with the community and if there's an <strong>Article</strong> or a <strong>Podcast</strong> you think I should appear on then feel free to get in touch too!

                                        This week saw the release of <strong>Episode Two</strong> of the <a href="../podcast/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> about the <strong>Windows App SDK</strong>.
                                        Is great to be able to share interests with others in a new way, having done <strong>Presentations</strong> and <strong>Articles</strong> before it is good to be able to add a <strong>Podcast</strong>!
                                        For those who might be interested I use the <strong>Shure MV-7</strong> microphone and record using <strong>Sound Recorder</strong> in <strong>Windows 11</strong> and then edit using <strong>Audacity</strong> 
                                        and then use <strong>Microsoft ClipChamp</strong> to create the version for <strong>YouTube</strong> and distribute the audio version using <strong>Anchor</strong>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This month will be my very first <strong>Presentation</strong> for this year which will be about <strong>Microsoft & AI</strong> for <a href="http://ne-bytes.github.io" target="_blank">NEBytes</a>
                                        where will be talking about the new innovations from <strong>Microsoft</strong> such as the new <strong>Bing</strong> with a overview of how it works and showing it in action along with <strong>Microsoft Designer</strong> to create
                                        some designs and images aided by AI.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There's also something I helped out with which I'll hopefully be able to share details of soon, when someone reached out to me about a project I'd done, which might be easy to guess if know what projects I have done.
                                        It is amazing to think the impact that project has had and to have someone else use that as a basis in their own work is fantastic and looking forward to sharing details when I can.
                                    </p>
