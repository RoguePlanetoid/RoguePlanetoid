                        <img src="assets/rogueplanetoid.png" class="img-fluid" alt="RoguePlanetoid Weekly Update #67">                                                                     
                        <p>
                          This week was great to make some progress with some upcoming projects, one of which is a new <strong>Podcast</strong> I'm working on which I'll be sharing more details about 
                          soon. I also went along to the <strong>Silicon Summer</strong> event for <strong>Silicon Mingle</strong> which was a great opportunity to catch up with people, many I hadn't 
                          seen in a while as well as meet some new people and talk about how am helping new and existing podcasters with <a href="https://www.cluarantonn.com/" target="_blank">Cluarantonn</a>. 
                          There was also a chance the following morning to go along to another <strong>The Mussel Club</strong> event and make some new connections, it is great to get out and meet so 
                          many amazing people and find out about all the things they are doing too. It is fantastic to not only be part of an amazing Tech Scene in the North East of England but be also 
                          part of the wider small business community here.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          This week ended with some amazing news which I've also posted about which was being awarded the <strong>Microsoft MVP Award</strong> for <strong>.NET</strong> and 
                          <strong>Windows Development</strong> in recognition of the hard work I've been doing and will continue to do for the developer community not just here in the 
                          North East of England but also in the wider community too, so was a fantastic way to end the week. <a href="../podcast/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> also saw the release 
                          of the latest <strong>Episode</strong> about <a href="../podcast/episode-twenty">Windows 11 Widgets</a> which I have been learning about for the past few weeks and hope 
                          to speak about at an event in the future too, especially as I can now add after my name that I'm a <strong>Microsoft MVP</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Next week I'll be continuing some projects I'm working on and to built upon the things I've been doing and the recognition becoming a <strong>Microsoft MVP</strong> as well 
                          as planning ahead for a few things I'll be doing or learning this month, so there's still plenty of work to be done but with this month already off to an amazing start and 
                          if it continues like it has started it will be an superb September!

                          Today sees the <strong>Release</strong> of version <strong>2.1.0</strong> of my <a href="https://comentsys.com/packages/toolkits/" target="_blank">Toolkit</a> of <strong>Comentsys.Toolkit.WindowsAppSdk</strong> for <strong>Windows App SDK</strong> 
                          on both <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Comentsys.Toolkit.WindowsAppSdk" target="_blank">NuGet</a> and open-source on 
                          <a href="https://github.com/Comentsys/Comentsys.Toolkit.WindowsAppSdk" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. This <strong>Release</strong> adds more support for <strong>Windows 11 Widgets</strong> 
                          including helping to create customisable <strong>Widgets</strong> as well as methods that can be used when a <strong>Widget</strong> is added to or removed from the <strong>Widgets Board</strong>. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          It was great to be able to release this updated <strong>Comentsys.Toolkit.WindowsAppSdk</strong> the same day that I received my <strong>Microsoft MVP</strong> award, which 
                          didn't even take into account this newly updated package, but is my way of helping <strong>Windows App SDK</strong> developers using <strong>.NET</strong> everywhere who 
                          want to create <strong>Windows 11 Widgets</strong>.

                          Today it was fantastic to see that I had received the <strong>MVP (Most Valuable Professional Award)</strong> from <strong>Microsoft</strong> for <strong>.NET</strong> 
                          and <strong>Windows Development</strong>. The <strong>MVP Award</strong> is there to recognise the exceptional contributions from those in the <strong>Microsoft</strong> technical 
                          community for their expertise, leadership, speaking experience, influence and commitment to solving issues that impact people in their lives. I am both honoured and 
                          humbled to have received this award today and become a <strong>Microsoft MVP</strong>!  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          I've been a software developer for over thirty years starting out on my <strong>Commodore 64</strong> coding in <strong>BASIC</strong>, then moving more toward the 
                          <strong>Microsoft</strong> ecosystem with <strong>Visual Basic 6</strong> before finally witnessing the arrival of <strong>.NET</strong> with the original <strong>.NET Framework</strong> which I have 
                          witnessed grow from its roots to the modern <strong>.NET</strong> it is today which has included over twenty years of professional experience as a developer first using 
                          <strong>VB.NET</strong> and mostly to now using <strong>C#</strong>. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          I've seen platforms come and go that use <strong>.NET</strong> but always been willing to share what I know from day one with tutorials or help people get started or progress in their careers 
                          or get interested in development with my workshops. I've also shared what I know over the years with my presentations which now next to my name can put that I am a 
                          <strong>Microsoft MVP</strong>!
