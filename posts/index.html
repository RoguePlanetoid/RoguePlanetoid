                        <p>
                          This week was packed full of events starting with <strong>North East Dev Community</strong> which was held at Durham University at their Department of 
                          Computer Science and Department of Mathematical Sciences, it was a fantastic venue! The event started with <strong>Andrew Buckingham</strong> talking 
                          about <a href="https://andrewbuckingham.github.io/2024/03/02/Collections-Classes-Clocks" target="_blank">Collections, Classes and Clocks</a>,  
                          which was then followed by my own talk, <strong>Take a Note of XAML with .NET 8</strong>, which I really enjoyed delivering and was the first time I 
                          had my own clicker for the slides which came in handy. I also wrote an <strong>Article</strong> about the 
                          <a href="../articles/north-east-dev-community-feb-2024/">North East Dev Community - February 2024</a> event which covered both talks!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          This week also saw yet another <strong>Silicon Mingle</strong>, it was amazing to go along to the Town Wall pub for this great networking event which 
                          had a few familiar faces from recent events I'd only met there along with some new faces plus those I'd met at previous events! It was fantastic to 
                          catch up with those I'd met before and met new people there, it is a fantastic event to see what people are doing and how they can and do help each 
                          other, there's no feeling of competition here in the North East just a feeling of collaboration and is great to be part of that culture!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Yesterday saw <a href="https://www.dddnorth.co.uk" target="_blank">DDD North</a> held at the University of Hull, and I travelled down on the Friday 
                          to Hull from Gateshead via Newcastle and Leeds and stayed just across the road from the venue so would not have far to go in the morning! It was great 
                          to see a few familiar faces there too and meet up with more people, the first session was <strong>Introduction to StereoKit Mixed Reality Development</strong> by 
                          Lee Englestone followed by <strong>Supercharge your data with Azure AI Search and Open AI</strong> by Pete Gallagher then onto 
                          <strong>May the Forms Be with You: A New Hope with Blazor Hybrid on WinForms</strong> by Don Wibier before breaking for Lunch. The first session after lunch was my own, 
                          an extended version of <strong>Take a Note of XAML with .NET 8</strong>, and it went well and had great questions and interest in the talk which was fantastic! 
                          The day ended with <strong>Extending Copilot with Copilot Studio</strong> by Dylan Hayes who announced he had just been recently made a Microsoft MVP, which was great! 
                          The day ended with a prize draw and although didn't win anything it was great to see those who did including one who won a Concorde Lego set that I 
                          had my eye on complementing me on my talk which was great and congratulated them on winning the set. The only downside of the day was missing talks 
                          that coincided with ones I had been to and hope to catch those in some form in the future! Overall <strong>DDD North</strong> was a great community event to be part 
                          of that I always look forward to attending or speaking at and wrote an <strong>Article</strong> covering the sessions I attended, including my own on <a href="../articles/ddd-north-2024">DDD North 2024</a>.
