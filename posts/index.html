                        <img src="assets/rogueplanetoid.png" class="img-fluid" alt="RoguePlanetoid Weekly Update #2"/>
                        <p>
                            This week saw the update of all existing <strong>Tutorials</strong> for <strong>Windows App SDK</strong> on 
                            <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com" target="_blank">tutorialr.com</a> to be available in PDF and HTML and have started writing the rest in both formats together
                            which is a lot easier, over halfway through the games it has been fun to put those together and either port the ones from <strong>Universal Windows Platform</strong> 
                            or write all new ones.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've been planning what <strong>Presentations</strong> I'm going to be doing this year with some developer focused ones but also really want to do one about <strong>Zune</strong>
                            so will be interesting if I can identify an event where I could do that one, I'm open to any suggestions via <a href="https://www.twitter.com/RoguePlanetoid" target="_blank">Twitter</a>
                            but will aim to do even more talks than I did in 2022 and I did the most ever then so am looking forward to speaking at an event in the near future!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm also planning on writing more <strong>Articles</strong> here about topics I'm interested in with an aim to do a few a month, 
                            not only that I'll be adding my articles from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/RoguePlanetoid" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> here too.
                            I've got a lot of things planned this year including things I've been wanting to do for a while so will post updates on anything I do right here!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Every single existing thirty-two <strong>Tutorials</strong> for <strong>Windows App SDK</strong> have now been updated to be available not only in 
                            <strong>PDF</strong> format on <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com" target="_blank">tutorialr.com</a> but in <strong>HTML</strong> which was a great suggestion by <a href="https://twitter.com/thenickrandolph/" target="_blank">Nick Randolph</a>! I've also made some minor 
                            corrections as well as adding the name of the tutorial on the title page which looks a lot better!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Every week on <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com" target="_blank">tutorialr.com</a> will be Tutorial Tuesday where 
                            I will add four new ones, with <strong>Lucky Bunny</Strong>, <strong>Lucky Racer</strong>, <strong>Chessboard</strong> and <strong>Tetrominos</strong> coming next week 
                            and a set of four coming each week after that until I reach one-hundred <strong>Tutorials</strong> for <strong>Windows App SDK</strong> 
                            so keep checking back for more!

                        <p>
                            Something new for this week is a new <strong>Weekly Update</strong> post where I'll cover what's going on in the world of software development 
                            and tech along with what I'm working on myself. So far, my focus this year has been to update the <strong>Tutorials</strong> for <strong>Windows App SDK</strong> 
                            on <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com" target="_blank">tutorialr.com</a> to be available in PDF and HTML and have completed this ahead of schedule this week, 
                            so rather than release them on 31st January as planned they'll be released on the 17th of January and will add four new ones in both PDF and HTML 
                            format each week from the 24th of January until I reach the full one-hundred tutorials!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It has been interesting to see ChatGPT at <a href="https://chat.openai.com" target="_blank">chat.openai.com</a> has become well known, in more demand, and being used for more things. 
                            It was rumoured this week that Microsoft will integrate this functionality into Bing, and they will be investing billions of 
                            dollars into OpenAI and even take a 49% stake in the company, will be interesting to see what comes of this collaboration 
                            with Microsoft in the future!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This week I'll also be planning on what I'm going to be doing in the first half of 2023, with the completion of the <strong>Tutorials</strong> for
                            <strong>Windows App SDK</strong> along with bringing some of my presentations I've done that were recorded to <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com" target="_blank">tutorialr.com</a> 
                            and will also feature my WPF and Modern .NET talk there. I'm also planning on writing some new talks for 2023 which 
                            I'll hopefully be doing at events this year along with more posts and articles here!

                            First week of 2023 has been working on some upcoming updates to <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com" target="_blank">tutorialr.com</a> for 
                            <strong>Tutorials</strong> for <strong>Windows App SDK</strong> to create <strong>HTML</strong> versions of them which 
                            will be published on 31st January kicking off regular <strong>Tutorial Tuesday</strong> updates there throughout the year,
                            with four <strong>Tutorials</strong> being published each week for the next few weeks with more games, then apps and more coming this year!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Was great to relaunch <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com" target="_blank">tutorialr.com</a> last year and this year will have even more 
                            content being added throughout the year! It has been great to hear feedback on the work there, the <strong>HTML</strong> versions of
                            <strong>Tutorials</strong> being one of the ideas suggested! Sharing knowledge is the key focus and will be sharing even more this year.
