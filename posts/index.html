                                    <p>
                                        This week I did my talk <strong>Blazor a trail with .NET 8</strong> at <a href="https://www.devhubnorth.com/" target="_blank">DevHub North</a> where 
                                        I joined <strong>Gary Brown</strong> from <strong>AND Digital</strong> talking about <strong>Agile IT Architecture Design: Building Efficient and 
                                        Effective Systems for AWS and Beyond</strong>. It was an amazing experience, I had put together great slides along with an interesting and fun demo 
                                        but doing the talk itself was the best part! I think it was the best talk I'd ever done and seemed many of those there also really enjoyed the talk,
                                        also the other talk was really interesting and informative so was pleased to see another great talk along with everyone else! If you missed out, or
                                        want to read about them then you can with my <strong>Article</strong> about <a href="../articles/dev-hub-north-october-2023/">DevHub North - October 2023</a>!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This week also saw some big <strong>Microsoft</strong> news of <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/10/13/xbox-activision-blizzard" target="_blank">Activision Blizzard King joins Xbox</a>!
                                        That completes the $69 billon dollar merger, the largest ever done by <strong>Microsoft</strong> but also ensures than many titles not on <strong>Xbox</strong> will remain on those platforms,
                                        but also means a strong portfolio of current and potential games coming to <strong>Xbox</strong>! I enjoy playing games myself sometimes, such as the recently released <strong>Starfield</strong>,
                                        so it will be interesting to see what this deal means for gamers in the long term, but for now it is great to see this deal close! It is especially great to see this as the last hurdle was overcoming 
                                        my own country's <strong>Competition and Markets Authority</strong>, but was pleased that they finally gave the go ahead which allowed the deal to be completed!                                        
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Next week I'll be at <strong>Microsoft Build: AI Day</strong> in <strong>London</strong>, speakers include <strong>Scott Hanselman</strong>, <strong>Amy Boyd</strong>, <strong>Anthony Shaw</strong>,
                                        <strong>Burke Holland</strong>, <strong>Chris Reddington</strong>, <strong>Henk Boelman</strong>, <strong>Joylynn Kirui</strong>, <strong>Liam Hampton</strong>, <strong>Paul Yu</strong>,
                                        <strong>Steven Murawski</strong>, <strong>Seth Juarez</strong> and <strong>Dona Sarkar</strong>. It will be amazing to see the speakers there as many of them I've only seen on live streams,
                                        so it will be great to see them in person, and hopefully say hello if they're not too busy! Also it will be great to see and meet any fellow attendees and learn about using AI as a developer,
                                        something I'm keen to learn more about! You can still register for <a href="https://msevents.microsoft.com/event?id=3925877575" target="_blank">Microsoft Build: AI Day</a> along with finding out 
                                        more about the day, and for anyone there then feel free to say hello, will be great to see you! I'll be travelling down to <strong>London</strong> the day before so if you're there too am happy to 
                                        meet up and talk about AI together!

                                        This week it was great to be able to write, record and edit the <strong>Episode</strong> about <a href="../podcast/episode-nine/">.NET 8</a> for the <a href="../podcast/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a>!
                                        <strong>.NET 8</strong> will be the latest version of .NET with enhanced app building experience with easy container creation, cross-platform versatility, improved Linux support, and secure supply chain capabilities.
                                        You can get the release candidate of <strong>.NET 8</strong> from <a href="https://dot.net/next" target="_blank">dot.net/next</a> or wait for it to be released during 
                                        <a href="https://www.dotnetconf.net/" target="_blank">.NET Conf 2023</a> between the 14th and 16th of November.

                                        Next week I'll be doing my talk <strong>Blazor a trail with .NET 8</strong> at <a href="https://www.devhubnorth.com/" target="_blank">DevHub North</a> which will be joining another talk 
                                        <strong>Agile IT Architecture Design: Building Efficient and Effective Systems for AWS and Beyond</strong> by <strong>Gary Brown</strong> from <strong>AND Digital</strong>. 
                                        If you want to come along then the event will be at <strong>TusPark</strong> in Newcastle upon Tyne on the 10th of October from 5:30pm and can sign up via
                                        <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/devhub-north-october-meetup-tickets-728285029127" target="_blank">DevHub North - October Meetup</a>. I'll be showing off new features of <strong>.NET 8</strong>,
                                        <strong>C# 12</strong> and <strong>Blazor</strong> plus a demo app that I've put together especially for the talk!

                                    <p>
                                        Next week I'll be finishing off the other talk I had been putting together about <strong>Zune</strong> and <strong>Windows Phone</strong> and hopefully be able to do that in the near future,
                                        it has been really fun to put that together and am not only hoping to do the talk without reading too much from speaker notes but I'll also have something things to show off related to the talk.
                                        That talk is going to be a real challenge for me, but my aim is to improve my skills as a speaker so I can do even more events in the future and hopefully represent developers from and living in the 
                                        North East of England at talks around the country and maybe even further afield in the future!
