                        <p>
                          This week it was announced officially that I would be speaking at <strong>.NET Notts</strong> in Nottingham on 28th of April to deliver my talk, <strong>Take a Note of XAML with .NET 8!</strong> 
                          It will be great to deliver this talk again to a new audience both in person and online as will be a hybrid event! If you're able to make it along or what to check it out 
                          online then you can sign up for the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/dotnetnotts/events/300470460" target="_blank">[HYBRID] ML Algorithms - Simon Painter & XAML with .NET 8 - Peter Bull</a> event which 
                          will also feature <strong>Simon Painter</strong> talking about <strong>Basic Machine Learning Algorithms</strong>. I'm really looking forward to going along and visiting 
                          Nottingham for the very first time, hopefully will have more opportunities to talk at future events around the country!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          This week it was also <strong>Record Store Day</strong> and I paid a visit to <a href="https://reflexrecordshop.com/" target="_blank">Reflex Record Shop</a> in Newcastle upon Tyne 
                          where I picked up <strong>MIKE OLDFIELD, HERGEST RIDGE, THE 1974 DEMO</strong>. I was lucky to get it as was told when queuing there were only four out of a thousand left that 
                          they had but was in luck as by the time I got to the front of the queue I was able to get my own copy! I'm really pleased I went along and was joined in the queue by so many 
                          other people, including one who I chatted along with the whole time which made the queuing not feel so long, is great to be able to support local Record Shops like that 
                          and really glad I decided to make the trip and didn't come back empty handed!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Next week I will be getting ready to go along to <a href="https://www.crimecon.co.uk/" target="_blank">Crimecon</a> in Glasgow to help represent the 
                          <a href="https://www.scottishmurders.com" target="_blank">Scottish Murders</a> Podcast. We'll have some pens and torches to give away along with stickers for those coming along! I've 
                          been to a couple before but wasn't able to make it to the one last year so am really looking forward to being able to go along this year and check out the sessions there too!
                        </p>

                          This week saw the release of <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com/talks/rules-engine-with-dot-net" target="_blank">Rules Engine with .NET</a> which is a 
                          <strong>Talk</strong> on <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com" target="_blank">tutorialr.com</a> which explains what is a <strong>Rules Engine</strong>,                                                   
                          talking about the <strong>Microsoft Rules Engine</strong> along with an example showing off the Rules Engine in .NET. Plus there was also an <strong>Article</strong>
                          about <a href="../articles/rules-engines/">Rules Engines</a> with more general information about <strong>Rules Engines</strong>. What I didn't expect is how popular 
                          the video would be on <a href="https://youtu.be/AVqRZBSSRrg" target="_blank">YouTube</a> which as of this post has almost <strong>400</strong> views, which is incredible! 
                          It has certainly rewarded the time and effort it took which was many hours of work to put together the video so pleased it has been so well received and 
                          is already one of the most popular videos I've done on my <a href="https://youtu.be/@rogueplanetoid" target="_blank">Channel</a> on <strong>YouTube</strong>!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Next week thanks to that success with the <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com/talks" target="_blank">tutorialr.com Talk</a> on <strong>Rules Engine with .NET</strong> 
                          that it has inspired me to already start work on the second video for another <strong>Talk</strong> which will be on <strong>Windows Presentation Foundation with .NET</strong> 
                          so am looking forward to putting that together and releasing that very soon! It also takes cues from recent talks I've done including the <strong>Take a Note of XAML with .NET 8</strong>, 
                          which I'm happy to say I will be doing again for a new audience in Nottingham on Monday 29th of April, so am really looking forward to it along with being happy to announce 
                          that here first!

                          <strong>Rules Engine with .NET</strong> will talk about <strong>.NET</strong> along with <strong>Console</strong> and <strong>Blazor</strong> applications.
                          Then will cover what is a <strong>Rules Engine</strong>, covering the <strong>Microsoft Rules Engine</strong> and then showing a <strong>Demo</strong>
                          which should hopefully help with understanding <strong>Rules Engine with .NET</strong>!

                        <p>
                          This week saw the release of the fifteenth <strong>Episode</strong> of the <a href="../articles/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> about <a href="../podcast/episode-fifteen/">.NET MAUI</a>. 
                          It was great to speak about <strong>.NET MAUI</strong> again and as mentioned in the last <strong>Weekly Update</strong>, the first time I'd used it was for my talk, 
                          <strong>Take a Note of XAML with .NET 8</strong>, after having used Xamarin a few years ago! The release of that Episode also coincided with the week of 
                          <strong>Google Podcasts</strong> starting to be shut down, so the <strong>RoguePlanetoid Podcast</strong> has now moved to <a href="https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgiM4DWdCrGBNgLf3f7qRHkz5m7akqW4F" target="_blank">YouTube Music</a>, 
                          where you'll find that latest <strong>Episode</strong> and all previous <strong>Episodes</strong>. It was great to see that not only has the latest <strong>Episode</strong> 
                          gained new downloads there but many previous <strong>Episodes</strong> too!

                          Next week will see the release of something I've been working on the past couple of weeks which will be a new <a href="https://tutorialr.com/talks" target="_blank">tutorialr.com Talk</a>, 
                          <strong>Rules Engine with .NET</strong>, which will be released this Thursday as have had <strong>Tutorial Tuesday</strong>, <strong>Workshop Wednesday</strong> in the past, 
                          so this week will see a <strong>Talk Thursday</strong>! These <strong>Talks</strong> do take quite some time to put together compared to a <strong>Podcast</strong>, 
                          so I aim to release about one every few months! This first <strong>Talk</strong> will bale about what a <strong>Rules Engine</strong> is along with an example plus a demo 
                          showing how the <strong>Rules Engine</strong> is used in a simple application! It has been great to finally work on a <strong>Talk</strong> after adding the first Talks 
                          three years ago when <a href="https://tutorialr.com" target="_blank">tutorialr.com</a> launched!
