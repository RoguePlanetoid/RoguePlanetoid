                                        <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Spotify.NetStandard" target="_blank">Spotify.NetStandard</a> has reached over <strong>10,000</strong> downloads since it was originally released in 2019!
                                        Since then it has been updated with a few minor versions and a couple of major versions with the most recent update with some minor changes today, it is amazing to see how popular this <strong>Package</strong>
                                        has become, which originally started as a weekend project to see what I could do with <a href="https://developer.spotify.com" target="_blank">Spotify for Developers</a>.

                                        <strong>Spotify.NetStandard</strong> has also helped me create a few versions of a <strong>Presentation</strong> about <a href="https://youtu.be/dC6U2uPWk-A" target="_blank">Spotify for Developers</a> along with being the basis of <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com/workshops/blazorfy" target="_blank">Blazorfy</a>
                                        which was a <strong>Workshop</strong> that combined <a href="https://blazor.net" target="_blank">Blazor</a> and <a href="https://spotify.com" target="_blank">Spotify</a>.

                                        This week was pleased to see the video of the two talks for <a href="https://ne-bytes.github.io" target="_blank">NEBytes</a> on <strong>How to move from Manual Testing to Automated Testing with Postman</strong> by Ian Douglas 
                                        and my own on <strong>Microsoft & AI</strong> are now on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2g7uC4UelI" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. I[m pleased the video already has around thirty views as of this post,
                                        so feel free to check it out and catch up with both talks if you missed them! I really enjoyed putting together the <strong>Microsoft & AI</strong> and spent quite a long time putting it together, even updating it an hour
                                        beforehand as things were being announced then that I was able to include!    
                                    </p>

                                        This week I posted some <a href="../articles/blazor-games/">Blazor Games</a> which ported across some of the games I had done for <strong>Windows App SDK</strong> to <strong>Blazor</strong>, not only
                                        that while doing this I also learned how to publish the games to <a href="https://rogueplanetoid.github.io/Blazor.Games" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> which was really interesting and something
                                        I will do with <strong>Blazor</strong> examples in the future. I've also made a start on a project using <strong>Blazor</strong> for work as they asked me to present something for their 
                                        <strong>Learning at Work</strong> week they are doing next month, so is great to be doing more <strong>Blazor</strong> again!
                                    </p>

                                        I've started writing the fourth <strong>Episode</strong> of the <a href="../podcast/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> which I can exclusively reveal here will be about <strong>Spotify for Developers</strong> which
                                        is something I've had an interest in over the past few years and is good to cover once more but this time in a <strong>Podcast</strong> and get more developers aware of this service from <strong>Spotify</strong>!

                                        It was great to be back at <a href="https://www.makerspace.org.uk/" target="_blank">Maker Space</a> again yesterday and get started with a project! Mine was to get the <strong>Eaglemoss Vector 3 3D Printer</strong> from the 
                                        <strong>Eaglemoss 3D Create & Print Partwork</strong> working again after being unused for a few years. My 3D printer had been well looked after and was only a little 
                                        dusty on the top but with a bit of a clean and checking of a few components I was able to breathe life into it again, after locating the software which took
                                        a bit of time as the publishers and the website for the partwork were long gone. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I was able to remove the filament that had been left within the extruder the past few years once I was able to connect and command the software to heat it up and retract the piece. 
                                        The rest of the filament itself was not able to be used, as it was degraded after so much time, but I was able to load up the 3D printer with some brand-new filament and will be ready to do a 
                                        test print on my next visit to <strong>Maker Space</strong>!

                                        This week was the first week in a while that might have had no events to go to if it hadn't been for <a href="https://www.makerspace.org.uk/" target="_blank">Maker Space</a> having their first Welcome Wednesday in their new 
                                        Gateshead home! It was great to be in <strong>Maker Space</strong> again and wrote an <strong>Article</strong> about <a href="../articles/maker-space/" target="_blank">Maker Space</a> that features some photographs I took of the new place. 
                                        It was great to see everyone there  and chat to people I'd not seen for years and soon seemed like no time had passed since the last time I had been there over three years ago, 
                                        looking forward to going to <strong>Maker Space</strong> again soon!

                                        1st of April was April Fool's Day but you wouldn't have been a fool for checking out the latest <strong>Episode</strong> of the <a href="../podcast">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> about <a href="../podcast/episode-three">Microsoft & AI</a>, 
                                        it was great to put this <strong>Episode</strong> together and cover this topic more, after doing my presentation about it at <a href="../articles/nebytes-march-2023/">NEBytes</a> 
                                        was good to talk a little more about it, things are changing so fast in that space as the episode had extra bits recorded after the initial recording right up to the day before it was released! 
                                        Talking of podcasts was very pleased to see that my wife's podcast, <a href="https://www.scottishmurders.com/" target="_blank">Scottish Murders</a>, had been shortlisted for <strong>Best Indie Podcast</strong> at the 
                                        <a href="https://truecrimeawards.co.uk/" target="_blank">Inaugural CrimeCon UK True Crime Awards</a> in London this year, so will be great to go along for that in June along with 
                                        <a href="https://www.crimecon.co.uk/" target="_blank">CrimeCon</a> itself a few days later and help represent <strong>Scottish Murders</strong>!
                                    </p>                                        
                                    <p>
                                        I had submitted a talk to the <a href="https://scottishsummit.com/" target="_blank">Scottish Summit</a> for this year, <strong>How sharing can make you a better developer</strong>, 
                                        for their on-tour event in Manchester, England. However, I was not selected, but the positive thing is I now have an extra session I can attend and from the other talks that did make 
                                        it they all sound interesting so will be tough to pick which ones to attend but know whatever ones I pick I'll learn something from those sessions! There is some good news they are 
                                        doing a Pre-Day YouTube event and have already mentioned I'd like to participate so am pleased people may be able to see the talk beforehand and am looking forward to going along 
                                        to the <strong>Scottish Summit</strong> on the 5th of August!
