                                        This week was the first week in a while that might have had no events to go to if it hadn't been for <a href="https://www.makerspace.org.uk/" target="_blank">Maker Space</a> having their first Welcome Wednesday in their new 
                                        Gateshead home! It was great to be in <strong>Maker Space</strong> again and wrote an <strong>Article</strong> about <a href="../articles/maker-space/" target="_blank">Maker Space</a> that features some photographs I took of the new place. 
                                        It was great to see everyone there  and chat to people I'd not seen for years and soon seemed like no time had passed since the last time I had been there over three years ago, 
                                        looking forward to going to <strong>Maker Space</strong> again soon!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        1st of April was April Fool's Day but you wouldn't have been a fool for checking out the latest <strong>Episode</strong> of the <a href="../podcast">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> about <a href="../podcast/episode-three">Microsoft & AI</a>, 
                                        it was great to put this <strong>Episode</strong> together and cover this topic more, after doing my presentation about it at <a href="../articles/nebytes-march-2023/">NEBytes</a> 
                                        was good to talk a little more about it, things are changing so fast in that space as the episode had extra bits recorded after the initial recording right up to the day before it was released! 
                                        Talking of podcasts was very pleased to see that my wife's podcast, <a href="https://www.scottishmurders.com/" target="_blank">Scottish Murders</a>, had been shortlisted for <strong>Best Indie Podcast</strong> at the 
                                        <a href="https://truecrimeawards.co.uk/" target="_blank">Inaugural CrimeCon UK True Crime Awards</a> in London this year, so will be great to go along for that in June along with 
                                        <a href="https://www.crimecon.co.uk/" target="_blank">CrimeCon</a> itself a few days later and help represent <strong>Scottish Murders</strong>!
                                    </p>                                        
                                    <p>
                                        I had submitted a talk to the <a href="https://scottishsummit.com/" target="_blank">Scottish Summit</a> for this year, <strong>How sharing can make you a better developer</strong>, 
                                        for their on-tour event in Manchester, England. However, I was not selected, but the positive thing is I now have an extra session I can attend and from the other talks that did make 
                                        it they all sound interesting so will be tough to pick which ones to attend but know whatever ones I pick I'll learn something from those sessions! There is some good news they are 
                                        doing a Pre-Day YouTube event and have already mentioned I'd like to participate so am pleased people may be able to see the talk beforehand and am looking forward to going along 
                                        to the <strong>Scottish Summit</strong> on the 5th of August!
