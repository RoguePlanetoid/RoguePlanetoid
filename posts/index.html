                                    <p>
                                        This week saw the last couple of <strong>Tutorials</strong> for now for <strong>Windows App SDK</strong> on 
                                        <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com" target="_blank">tutorialr.com</a> of <strong>Donut Control</strong> and <strong>Light Game</strong>.
                                        There's now fifty <strong>Tutorials</strong> for <strong>Windows App SDK</strong> available and looking forward to posting more later this year
                                        but it won't be the last thing about the <strong>Windows App SDK</strong> as there will be a <strong>Podcast</strong> episode about it on 1st March!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This week attended the <strong>North East Azure User Group</strong> which can read about at <a href="../articles/neaug-feb-2023">North East Azure User Group February 2023</a>
                                        and it was the first time I'd attended that event and it was really interesting to catch up with a few people I knew and meet a few I didn't too, looking forward to the next one!

                                        There was also <strong>Tech on the Tyne</strong> about <strong>Introducing Data Science, to understand what Twitter really thinks of Elon!</strong>
                                        which can read about at <a href="../articles/tech-on-the-tyne-feb-2023">Introducing Data Science, to understand what Twitter really thinks of Elon!</a>
                                        I'd held the last one they did but was really great to be on the other side this time and was an interesting talk and workshop and really looking forward to the next <strong>Tech on the Tyne</strong>!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This week also saw me starting a brand new job at <a href="https://bedegaming.com" target="_blank">Bede Gaming</a> and had a grear first week there getting to know those there
                                        and after getting setup and started have been working on a few things already which has been great and looking forward to seeing what I can do, learn and share there!
                                    </p>

                                        Controls include <strong>Donut Control</strong> where you can implement a <i>Donut Chart</i> and <strong>Light Control</strong> is where you implement a <i>Light</i> to indicate a state and use this to show the UK <i>Traffic Light</i> sequence.
                                        this is the last of the <strong>Tutorials</strong> using <strong>Windows App SDK</strong> for now but the remaining <i>fifty</i> will begin being published later this year!

                                        This week also the last four game <strong>Tutorials</strong> for <strong>Windows App SDK</strong> on 
                                        <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com" target="_blank">tutorialr.com</a> of <strong>Flags Game</strong>, <strong>Emoji Game</strong>,
                                        <strong>Words Game</strong> and <strong>Yatzy Game</strong>. It was especially interesting to write the <sttrong>Words Game</sttrong>
                                        as had planned on doing a <i>Lingo</i> game many years ago before <i>Wordle</i> but liked the keyboard mechanic of the latter game,
                                        so was good to implement that functionality. Next <strong>Tutorial Tuesday</strong> will finish off the first fifty <strong>Tutorials</strong>
                                        with the rest coming later this year.

                                        With a new year comes new talks to attend, next week will be at <strong>Tech on the Tyne</strong> about <strong>Introducing Data Science, to understand what Twitter really thinks of Elon!</strong>
                                        by <strong>Dr Hollie Johnson</strong>. Was great to be able to hold my <strong>Workshop</strong> about <strong>Blazorfy</strong> last year so am looking forward to being on the other side this time!
                                        although it is the same day as <strong>NEBytes</strong> so will hopefully catch that one which is about <strong>Troubleshooting Azure with Application Insights</strong> by <strong>Mike Stephenson</strong>.

                                        This week I attended my very first Concert at <strong>Sage Gateshead</strong> which was <strong>Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells - The 50th Anniversary Celebration UK Tour 2023</strong> and it was amazing,
                                        also had a wonderful dinner in the Brasserie there beforehand, which I highly recommend if attending anything there! Although <strong>Mike Oldfield</strong> himself was not involved it is the closest I'll
                                        probably ever get of a live performance in person of his work and was not disappointed, the performers were incredible, loved the way some moved around the stage and was great to experience it in my home town of <strong>Gateshead</strong>.

                                    <p>
                                        This week saw the start of adding some classic <strong>Articles</strong> from the past which will be added each week, with the first being about
                                        <a href="https://rogueplanetoid.com/articles/developer-day-2019/" target="_blank">Developer Day 2019</a> which was a great event a few years ago that I attended and presented at
                                        about <strong>Spotify for Developers</strong> and was the biggest event I've spoken at! Also, this week saw an <strong>Article</strong> about
                                        <a href="https://rogueplanetoid.com/articles/new-bing/">Bringing intelligence next gen with Bing</a> which was about new features being introduced to the 
                                        <strong>Bing</strong> search engine powered by AI, it will be interesting to see how this will be used and will be something will cover in the future in more detail!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This week also saw another four <strong>Tutorials</strong> for <strong>Windows App SDK</strong> on 
                                        <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com" target="_blank">tutorialr.com</a> of <strong>Order Game</strong>, <strong>Slide Game</strong>,
                                        <strong>Codes Game</strong> and <strong>Match Game</strong>. Also, to allow time to work on other projects, once the first fifty <strong>Tutorials</strong>
                                        for <strong>Windows App SDK</strong> are published then will publish the remaining fifty later in the year. However, there will be more about <strong>Windows App SDK</strong>
                                        as next month's <strong>Podcast</strong> will be about it!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        At the half-way point of the <strong>Tutorials</strong> for <strong>Windows App SDK</strong> it will be great to work on some new projects, which includes some brand-new
                                        <strong>Presentations</strong> as well as updates to other <strong>Projects</strong>, and will share <strong>Posts</strong> about these as soon as I can! 2022 was a great
                                        year where I did so many different things and aim to do even more this year!

                                        Games include <strong>Order Game</strong> where the aim of the game is to place all the squares in the correct order in the quickest time,
                                        <strong>Slide Game</strong> is based upon those fifteen-piece sliding puzzle games where you need to get the squares in the correct order.
                                        There's also <strong>Codes Game</strong> where you need to correctly guess the four-digit code and <strong>Match Game</strong> where you
                                        need to remember a pattern then reproduce it as many times as you possibly can!

                                        <strong>RoguePlanetoid Podcast</strong> launched this week which was hinted at last week, which answered the question
                                        of what is the blue for in the <strong>RoguePlanetoid</strong> logo! The <strong>RoguePlanetoid Podcast</strong> will be
                                        published each month with the first being an <strong>Overview of 2022</strong> along with <strong>Content Creation with AI</strong>.
                                        I'm happy to take input from the community to see what should be covered and if possible speak to others in the community and get them
                                        on the podcast, if you're interested then can contact me on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/rogueplanetoid" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.
                                    </p>

                                        This week saw the addition of another four <strong>Tutorials</strong> for <strong>Windows App SDK</strong> on 
                                        <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com" target="_blank">tutorialr.com</a> available in PDF and HTML of 
                                        <strong>Fruit Game</strong>, <strong>Touch Game</strong>, <strong>Light Game</strong> and <strong>Tiles Game</strong>.
                                        Hopefully once all the <strong>Tutorials</strong> for games have been published it might just be the one 
                                        of the largest collection of free and open-source games using <strong>Windows App SDK</strong> out there!

                                        There will also be some more <strong>Articles</strong> being posted here on the website this month which will include a couple about 
                                        <strong>Spotify</strong> along with adding some <strong>Articles</strong> from 
                                        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rogueplanetoid/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>. It is good updating a website again this year,
                                        it is in fact a very special year as it is twenty-five years since I started my original website and there will be <strong>Posts</strong>,
                                        <strong>Articles</strong> and a <strong>Podcast</strong> about this coming later in the year!

                                        will hopefully give an impression of what to look forward to in future episodes.

                                        You should find the <strong>Podcast</strong> where you listen to your podcasts such as <strong>Spotify</strong> along with <strong>YouTube</strong>
                                        will be posting episodes each month and is great to have something like this to add to the <strong>Posts</strong> and <strong>Articles</strong>
                                        here and hopefully have future <strong>Episodes</strong> with involvement with other members of the community and fellow podcasters!
