                        <p>
                          This week saw events such as <a href="https://www.thinkingdigital.co.uk" target="_blank">Thinking Digital</a> and <a href="https://thelateshows.org.uk/" target="_blank">The Late Shows</a>,
                          however I didn't make it to either event this year, but was great to see updates on social media from both events and hopefully will be able to make them next time! 
                          The reason I couldn't go to those events has been all the preparation and getting ready for next week for <a href="https://www.thepodcastshowlondon.com/" target="_blank">The Podcast Show</a>!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Next week I will be down in <strong>London</strong> for <a href="https://www.thepodcastshowlondon.com/" target="_blank">The Podcast Show</a>! 
                          This will be an event like nothing I've ever been to before, it has taken weeks of preparation and a lot of work this week to get ready,
                          but it will be worth all the time and effort! It will also be great to see my wife doing her first ever session at an event,
                          <strong>Beyond the Headlines: Ethical Diving into True Crime Podcast Investigations</strong> am very proud and can't wait to see that!

                          This week saw the release of <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com/talks/rules-engine-with-dot-net" target="_blank">Windows Presentation Foundation with .NET</a> which is a 
                          <strong>Talk</strong> on <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com" target="_blank">tutorialr.com</a> which talks about <strong>Windows Presentation Foundation</strong>,                                                   
                          and modern <strong>.NET</strong> along with an example showing off <strong>Windows Presentation Foundation</strong> taking advantage of the modern <strong>.NET</strong> 
                          ecosystem in a conventional way with <strong>Blazor Hybrid</strong> or unconventional ways such as <strong>ASP.NET Core Web API</strong> and an <strong>ASP.NET Core Web App</strong> 
                          being served from a <strong>Windows Presentation Foundation</strong> application and even part of <strong>Windows Presentation Foundation</strong> being served in an 
                          <strong>ASP.NET Core Web App</strong>. There was also an <strong>Article</strong> about <a href="../articles/windows-presentation-foundation/">Windows Presentation Foundation</a> 
                          with more general information about <strong>WPF</strong>. This second <strong>Talk</strong> on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z7EPIVJFu0" target="_blank">Windows Presentation Foundation with .NET</a>
                          has already gained over twenty views with the previous <strong>Talk</strong> on <a href="https://youtu.be/AVqRZBSSRrg" target="_blank">Rules Engine with .NET</a>

                          This week saw an amazing event witnessed in many places all over the world which was the <strong>Aurora Borealis</strong> and <strong>Aurora Australis</strong> reaching places far south or north of 
                          where they would usually be visible! I've always wanted to travel to see the <strong>Northern Lights</strong>, having never seen them before, but never imagined by first time ever 
                          seeing them would be right on my doorstep here in <strong>Gateshead</strong>! Not often you get to tick off a lifetime goal by just going outside, and that was the case for many people around the world 
                          who also witnessed it for the very first time wherever they live! I also took some amazing night-mode shots of the <strong>Aurora</strong> over <strong>Gateshead</strong> on my <strong>Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra</strong>!

                          Next week is <a href="https://thinkingdigital.co.uk/" target="_blank">Thinking Digital</a> although this year I'm not able to make it due to preparations for another event 
                          in London, <a href="https://www.thepodcastshowlondon.com/" target="_blank">The Podcast Show</a> so will have to catch as much of the life stream as I can, but hopefully 
                          I'll be able to attend again in person next year! It will be a busy week next week with getting ready for the event in London, but I'm looking forward to going down there 
                          nd writing about my experiences there here on this website!

                        <p>
                          This week I presented at my very first hybrid event for <strong>.NET Notts</strong> for those in person in Nottingham along with those joining online! If you missed 
                          the presentations, then you can check them out now on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuTmdJAl7bQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. 
                          It was a great experience travelling down to Nottingham for the very first time, there were some minor delays on the way but had factored those into 
                          my journey so if I'd missed a train, I'd be okay! I'm pleased to say I caught every train I was supposed to and even saved a bit of time at the end 
                          with the Trams in Nottingham saving me time getting from and to the station! I'm looking forward to doing another talk somewhere else in the UK in 
                          the future and was great to do my talk <strong>Take a Note of XAML with .NET 8</strong> again and got some great feedback afterwards!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          This week also saw the release of sixteenth <strong>Episode</strong> of the <a href="../podcast">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> about <a href="../podcast/episode-sixteen/">Uno Platform</a>, 
                          it was great to talk about <strong>Uno Platform</strong> again, I've covered it before two years ago and four years ago but hope to do more with it later this year! 
                          It has been great to see how much <strong>Uno Platform</strong> has evolved over the years since I first became aware of it, from when <strong>Universal Windows Platform</strong> 
                          was the technology to target Windows to it using WinUI 3 just like <strong>Windows App SDK</strong>. <strong>Uno Platform</strong> is an open-source platform for building 
                          native mobile, web, desktop and embedded apps in a single codebase using C# and XAML.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Next week will see the release of another <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com/talks" target="_blank">tutorialr.com Talk</a> on <strong>Windows Presentation Foundation with .NET</strong>, 
                          which will be released this Thursday! It was great to do a second <strong>Talk</strong> after the first, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVqRZBSSRrg" target="_blank">Rules Engine with .NET</a>, 
                          gained over 560 views on YouTube, already becoming one of the most popular videos I've ever done! I'm planning on doing more Talks later this year but is good to have completed 
                          this second one on <strong>Windows Presentation Foundation with .NET</strong>.
