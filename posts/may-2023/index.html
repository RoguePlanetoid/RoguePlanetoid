                                    <p>
                                        This week it was <a href="https://build.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Microsoft Build</a>, it was great to be able to catch all the sessions and write <strong>Articles</strong> for <a href="../articles/microsoft-build-2023-day-one">Day One</a> and <a href="../articles/microsoft-build-2023-day-one">Day Two</a>.
                                        There has never been a more exciting time to be a developer with the advent of Ai that promises to deliver the biggest change in computing for fifty years and to see just the start of that change in the past year has been incredible,
                                        and be able to build experiences using the same platform and tools <strong>Microsoft</strong> is using to build their own <strong>Copilots</strong> is really amazing to see as a developer!
                                        Covering <strong>Microsoft Build 2023</strong> in my <strong>Articles</strong> was a real challenge and posting the notes as soon as they were done was too, hopefully people forgive any typos / mistakes.
                                        Another way I'll be covering <strong>Microsoft Build 2023</strong> will be with my latest <strong>Episode</strong> of the <a href="../podcast/">Podcast</a> which will be recorded this week and available on June 1st!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Another thing I'll be doing each month for the next few months is celebrating the twenty-fifth year of my original website <a href="https://www.cespage.com" target="_blank">CESPage</a>,
                                        which was originally hosted on <strong>Geocities</strong> - if anyone remembers that, but moved a year later to its own domain and is now archived on <strong>GitHub</strong>.
                                        This month kicked that celebration off with a set of the original <strong>Tutorials</strong> for <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com/tutorials/vb6/" target="_blank">Visual Basic</a> 
                                        I wrote including the very first one from 1997 which contains the very first code from <strong>Visual Basic</strong>. It is amazing to think of having a website back then,
                                        it truly was a different time, with dial-up internet, and far fewer websites available, although that did mean that even ones like mine were popular with hundreds of visitors per day at times!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Next few things I'm working on will be my talk for <a href="https://scottishsummit.com/" target="_blank">Scottish Summit</a> on <strong>How sharing can make you a better developer</strong> for their <strong>YouTube</strong> 
                                        channel that will be made available before the event. I'll also be working on a couple of other things including one I cannot wait to share once it is done which I'm looking forward to.
                                        Longer term I have a few more things to do to help celebrate my original website as well as something that is nothing to do with programming at all, so should be an interesting month in June!
                                    </p>

                                        The very first content ever created on the website was a set of <strong>Tutorials</strong> for <strong>Visual Basic 6</strong> and to help celebrate they have all been republished on <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com/tutorials/vb6/">Tutorialr.com</a>,
                                        including <strong>Hello World</strong>, <strong>Hello Custom</strong>, <strong>Task Tray</strong>, <strong>Drawing</strong>, <strong>Simple Text Editor</strong>, <strong>Simple Drawing Package</strong>, <strong>Lucky Dice</strong>, <strong>Lucky Lotto</strong> and 
                                        <strong>Weblink ActiveX</strong>! These <strong>Tutorials</strong> are presented as-is, although I have learned a lot since they were originally written and many would be written differently but good to look back and see how far I have come as a developer since then,
                                        and be able to help celebrate by sharing these <strong>Tutorials</strong>.

                                        <a href="https://www.thelateshows.org.uk" target="_blank">The Late Shows</a> were held this week on Friday 19th of May and Saturday 20th of May.
                                        The first evening on the Friday was in Ouseburn and the surrounding areas and it was amazing to visit as many venues as I could including The Biscuit Factory, 
                                        The NewBridge Project, Biscuit Tin Studios, Shieldfield Art Works, Ouseburn Studio, Cobalt Studios, Gingerinos, Northern Print, Jim Edwards Studio Gallery, 
                                        36 Lime Street, Seven Stories, Bottleworks and Hotel Du Vin. I had been to <strong>The Late Shows</strong> before but there were still many venues I had never
                                        been to and even those I had been were either completely different from the last time I was there or had different artists in residence. It was great
                                        to talk to one artist about their work and it turned out they used to work with AutoCAD before retiring and we had a good chat about the impact AI was 
                                        having and the pace of change we both had seen.

                                    <p>
                                        The second evening of <strong>The Late Shows</strong> on the Saturday was around Gateshead and Newcastle and started with a visit to Maker Space in Gateshead, who were taking
                                        part and have done so for many years. I was pleased as a member to see everything people had to show off to the visitors, and there was even the surprise of seeing my own
                                        3D printer on display next to the others, which was a nice bonus. This was followed by a visit next door to Orbis Community before heading over the river to Newcastle to visit
                                        Bessie Surtees House then Newcastle Castle, Four Quarters, Newcastle Arts Centre, The Black Swan Venue Bar and finally the Assembly House. It was great to see
                                        a different side to Gateshead and Newcastle but the last two evenings had caught up with me and wasn't able to make it anywhere else, but it was still a fantastic
                                        experience to see all the places and amazing artwork that I had seen and experience places and sights I would not otherwise get to do!

                                        This week it was <strong>Learn at Work</strong> week at <a href="https://www.bedegaming.com" target="_blank">Bede</a> where I did a session on 
                                        <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com/workshops/blazor-emoji-bingo" target="_blank">Blazor Emoji Bingo</a>. It was the very first time I've done a 
                                        workshop where I also followed it along with those there. It was great to see so many people follow along with the Workshop and there was a special 
                                        bonus of a prize for the winner of the game at the end of the session which were a set of two 3D printed Emoji created last week at <strong>Maker Space</strong>
                                        at the last <strong>Welcome Wednesday</strong>. It was fun putting together the workshop and wanted to put as much effort as possible into it, 
                                        the other sessions for the Learn at Work Week have been really interesting too and was great to play a part in the experience.

                                        I've got a great schedule of content lined up to create this year, around this time last year was when I kicked off doing talks and more content but am pleased 
                                        that this year I've already done more than I had done last year. I have so many things I want to do, I've learned so much from talks and the community myself so 
                                        is great to be able to do my bit in return! I've got a few talks in mind I would like to deliver at a few events so will start getting some of that together, will 
                                        make sure this year is my biggest year ever for content!
                                    </p>                                        
                                    <p>
                                        Next week is <a href="https://build.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Microsoft Build</a> and I will be covering the conference here with <strong>Articles</strong> about 
                                        the keynotes and sessions  I'll be virtually attending, I'm hoping one day to be part delivering a session or going along to Seattle again to see it in person but will be 
                                        good to see it online, it has been really good the past few years and know this year it will be even more interesting with all the developments regarding AI, 
                                        which I've had a keen interest in!

                                        This week I was at <a href="https://www.makerspace.org.uk" target="_blank">Maker Space</a> for <strong>Welcome Wednesday</strong>, I didn't do a dedicated
                                        post as what I was doing there will be a surprise which is for something related to the <strong>Learn @ Work</strong> week at <a href="https://www.bedegaming.com" target="_blank">Bede</a>.
                                        I've almost finished my <strong>Workshop</strong> for the <strong>Learn @ Work</strong> week, which is <strong>Blazor Emoji Bingo</strong>, 
                                        I've enjoyed putting it together and is just the finishing touches and run throughs before I do it for real next week, 
                                        I'm really looking forward to it, along with attending a few of other sessions on offer!

                                        I've also been working on a few things to help celebrate the <strong>25th Anniversary</strong> of my original website which originally 
                                        started on <strong>Geocities</strong> before becoming <a href="https://www.cespage.com" target="_blank">CESPage.com</a>. I'll be reposting some original content as well as 
                                        some brand new content to help celebrate the websites! I have put together my schedule of all the work I am doing this year which will 
                                        include <strong>Articles</strong>, <strong>Episodes</strong> of the <a href="../../podcast/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> and more! 
                                        It is great to be even more active this year and have a whole lot of content planned I can't wait to put together and share!

                                        Next week along with it being <strong>Learn @ Work</strong> at <strong>Bede</strong> it is <a href="https://thelateshows.org.uk/" target="_blank">The Late Shows</a>, 
                                        which is where a lot of venues in Newcastle and Gateshead open up to the general public to show off what they do which will include <strong>Maker Space</strong>,
                                        I've been seeing some of the things they have prepared so will be good to pay a visit and also check out the other places that are showing 
                                        off things, I've done these events in the past but not for a while so is a great way of seeing things I wouldn't normally get the chance to see otherwise!

                                        This week saw the release of the fourth <strong>Episode</strong> of the <a href="../podcast" target="blank">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> about <a href="../podcast/episode-four" target="blank">Spotify for Developers</a>!
                                        On <strong>Twitter</strong> the <a href="https://twitter.com/spotifyplatform" target="blank">Spotify for Developers</a> account was kind enough to re-tweet about 
                                        the <strong>Episode</strong> which was amazing! It will be good to see if can encourage more developers to take advantage of the <strong>Spotify</strong> platform 
                                        in their applications with <strong>Spotify for Developers</strong>.

                                        This week saw the return of <a href="https://www.zune.net" target="_blank">Zune.net</a> <strong>Microsoft</strong> to promote <strong>STEM</strong> 
                                        including 3D printing a <strong>Zune</strong> on the <strong>International Space Station</strong> and the film <a href="https://www.marvel.com/movies/guardians-of-the-galaxy-volume-3" target="_blank">Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</a> 
                                        from <strong>Marvel Studios</strong> which features a <strong>Zune</strong>. As a big fan of <strong>Zune</strong> having created <a href="https://www.zunepedia.com" target="_blank">Zunepedia</a> 
                                        in 2021 I was very pleased to see this, so when I was at <strong>Maker Space</strong> this week I decided to mark this by 3D printing a <strong>Zune 80 / 120</strong> although am hopeful the model 
                                        of the original <strong>Zune</strong> being printed on the <strong>International Space Station</strong> will be made available to print down here on Earth!

                                        So far it has been great writing new <a href="../../articles">Articles</a> as well as reposting those <strong>Articles</strong> from <strong>LinkedIn</strong> with just 
                                        a few more of those to bring over! I'm working on a <strong>Workshop</strong> using <strong>Blazor</strong> for a <strong>Learn @ Work</strong> week at <strong>Bede</strong> 
                                        which I'm looking forward to delivering later this month and pleased to announce I'll be bringing it to <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com" target="_blank">Tutorialr.com</a> 
                                        the following month! I've also got a plan for the rest of the year with a few things I hope to get done including some which I'm also happy to announce here that will help 
                                        celebrate the 25th anniversary of my original website!

                                        It was another Welcome Wednesday at <a href="https://www.makerspace.org.uk/" target="_blank">Maker Space</a> and with many regulars, some who had not been for a while
                                        and some new potential members visiting. Inspired by the relaunched <a href="https://zune.net/" target="_blank">zune.net</a> to help inspire STEM learning including
                                        3D printing a <strong>Zune</strong> on the <strong>International Space Station</strong> to celebrate the release of <strong>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</strong> which features <strong>Zune</strong>, I decided to 3D print
                                        one right here on earth, I couldn't track down a model of an original <strong>Zune</strong> so chose the second-generation model which was the <strong>Zune 80 / 120</strong>!

                                        You can see the results of the print were pretty good, albeit in a much smaller scale version, alongside this was my second 3D print of the evening which was to help
                                        mark the announcement of a brand new animated <strong>Babylon 5</strong> movie that had just been announced by 
                                        <a href="https://twitter.com/straczynski/status/1653799076641779712" target="_blank">J. Michael Straczynski</a> on <strong>Twitter</strong> that day, which is a <strong>Link</strong>
                                        used by the characters in the original series such as <strong>Captain John Sheridan</strong> and was printed actual size! I'm looking forward to planning more things to print,
                                        which will hopefully be the model of the original <strong>Zune</strong> that is being planned to be printed <strong>International Space Station</strong>, 
                                        but if not will see what else I can print at <strong>Maker Space</strong> next Welcome Wednesday!

                                    <p>
                                        I never expected to see this day but <a href="https://www.zune.net" target="_blank">Zune.net</a> is back online!
                                        Although for a different reason as <strong>Microsoft</strong> has relaunched the website to encourage <strong>STEM</strong> in association 
                                        with the release of the film <a href="https://www.marvel.com/movies/guardians-of-the-galaxy-volume-3" target="_blank">Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</a> from <strong>Marvel Studios</strong>!
                                        <strong>Empowering the galaxy</strong> includes learning about <strong>3D Printing</strong>, guard the galaxy with 
                                        <a href="https://aka.ms/galaxy" target="_blank">Azure Space</a> and <a href="https://aka.ms/makeCodeZune" target="_blank">Create a Music Player</a>!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        It was amazing to see the original <strong>Zune</strong> make an appearance in <strong>Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2</strong> when Peter Quill was gifted
                                        one then and am pleased to see it also not only makes an appearance in the film but <strong>Microsoft</strong> is doing something like this, even going as february-2023
                                        as having <strong>Scott Hanselman</strong> talk about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLYhvJG30iE" target="_blank">Reviving a Microsoft Zune in 2023</a>,
                                        when I put together <a href="https://zunepedia.com" target="_blank">Zunepedia</a> in 2021 I never expected to hear anything from <strong>Microsoft</strong> about 
                                        <strong>Zune</strong> so it is amazing to see this happen!
