                                    <p>
                                        This week I was at two new events, the first was the <a href="../../articles/bbc-tech-hub-april-2023">BBC North East Technology Hub Meetup</a> at <strong>BBC Newcastle</strong> 
                                        which was their very first event held in the new space which used to be their club and bar. It was great to hear from those working there including some of their plans
                                        for what they'll be doing in the North East as well as their desire to be an integral part of the tech community, this was followed by discussion about <strong>Generative AI</strong>.
                                        The second event was <a href="../../articles/dev-hub-north-april-2023">DevHub North - April 2023</a> and although not a new event was new to me, which was about <strong>Developing in a Data Rich Future</strong> and
                                        <strong>Automating the hard part of AWS account management with a Step Function driven vending machine offering</strong>, it was great to go along and was the most well-attended event I have
                                        been to this year so far, I also expressed my desire to do a talk in future!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I've recorded and edited the next episode of the <a href="../../podcast/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> on <strong>Spotify for Developers</strong>. I've also taken on board some advice
                                        from <strong>Jamie Taylor</strong> host of the <a href="https://dotnetcore.show/" target="_blank">The .NET Core Podcast</a> when he appeared on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsts1JHlwg" target="_blank">Zero to 600k Podcast Downloads</a>
                                        with <strong>Steve Worthy</strong>, they were both amazing and had so many great ideas and also appreciated them mentioning me on the show! The first thing I am doing is to publish
                                        transcripts of all the <strong>Episodes</strong> when the latest is published on Monday. For future <strong>Episodes</strong> of the <strong>RoguePlanetoid Podcast</strong> I'll hopefully 
                                        apply more ideas and suggestions as I go along, I really appreciated the advice and help I've already had so far, it has been invaluable and looking forward to appearing on <strong>The .NET Core Podcast</strong>
                                        in the future!
                                    </p>

                                        Next week I'll be working on a project for a <strong>Learning at Work</strong> week which involves creating <strong>Blazor Emoji Bingo</strong>, I've been working on the game itself and will
                                        be putting together the session for it ready to be shared next month at work and will also share this later on <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com" target="_blank">tutoriar.com</a>! 
                                        Once that project is done I'll be preparing for <a href="https://build.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft Build 2023</a> next month which I'll be writing <strong>Articles</strong>
                                        for along with an <strong>Episode</strong> of the <strong>RoguePlanetoid Podcast</strong>!

                                        This week I paid another visit to <a href="https://www.makerspace.org.uk/" target="_blank">Maker Space</a> where I got my 3D printer working and printing again after so many years of it sitting unused but it had been well looked 
                                        after and was able to create a couple of objects which started with a test cube I had created when I first got the printer and was pleased that was succesful!
                                        It is also great to see so many new members, including one who was interested in 3D printing and was great to be able to talk to them and show then the succesful print 
                                        afterwards, looking forward to creating more things with it and seeing what kind of projects I can create in the future at <strong>Maker Space</strong>.    
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I've finished writing the next episode for the <a href="../../podcast/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> on <strong>Spotify for Developers</strong>, this will also have a companion 
                                        article to go over a few things there too and both mention my <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Spotify.NetStandard" target="_blank">Spotify.NetStandard</a> library for 
                                        using the Web API from <strong>Spotify</strong> using <strong>.NET</strong>. I was pleased to see that <strong>Spotify.NetStandard</strong> has got over 10,000 downloads since 
                                        it was first released a few years ago and am happy to see so many developers have downloaded it, am curious what they have used it for but have used it myself in a few projects
                                        including the <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com/workshops/blazorfy/" target="_blank">Blazorfy</a> workshop I did last year, and it is still being kept up to date!
                                    </p>                                        
                                    <p>
                                        Next week have a couple of new events including a brand-new even with the <strong>BBC North East Technology Hub Meetup</strong> and my first time at <strong>DevHub North</strong>, 
                                        so I'm looking forward to checking out both of those meetups. I've already been to more events this year than all the events last year and will be at some larger events later this year, 
                                        including <a href="https://www.scottishsummit.com/" target="_blank">Scottish Summit</a>, which will be in Manchester rather than Scotland along with the very different event of 
                                        <a href="https://www.crimecon.co.uk/" target="_blank">CrimeCon</a> in London. I'm also interested in doing some of my existing talks again for some user groups so if want me to come a
                                        long either online or in-person then let me know via <a href="https://www.twitter.com/rogueplanetoid" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.

                                        Welcome Wednesday at Maker Space <a href="https://www.makerspace.org.uk/" target="_blank">Maker Space</a> is a great way to see what is going on there for anyone new who wants 
                                        to check it out and become a member and for existing members it is a great way to see new people and catch up with other members. This Welcome Wednesday I returned to <strong>Maker Space</strong> try and 
                                        get my 3D printer working again after so many years of sitting in storage, last week I had already cleaned it up and replaced the filament but this week it was time to print something!

                                        I tracked down my original test cube when I first got my 3D printer working nearly four years ago so selected this to print and after making sure the filament was coming through correctly, 
                                        I began to attempt a print. However, the temperature of 183 Celsius wasn't possible so it refused to start printing the cube, however it could get to around 173 Celsius, so I stopped the print 
                                        and adjusted the temperature to that and was able to begin printing the cube. After just over half an hour I had successfully printed the cube, I was also joined by a new member who was 
                                        interested in 3D printing, so they were also pleased to see the print was successful.   
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I decide to 3D print another object, which was a computer mouse, although it was a bit smaller than designed and wasn't perfect it was fine and am looking forward to being able to print 
                                        something else with it! Afterwards we all head out to the pub to have a chat and talk about things together and is a great way for new members to get to know their fellow members a bit better too, 
                                        so if you live in the North East or are just visiting then feel free to pay a visit to Gateshead for <strong>Maker Space</strong> on the next Welcome Wednesday!

                                        Since then it has been updated with a few minor versions and a couple of major versions with the most recent update with some minor changes today, it is amazing to see how popular this <strong>Package</strong>
                                        has become, which originally started as a weekend project to see what I could do with <a href="https://developer.spotify.com" target="_blank">Spotify for Developers</a>.

                                        <strong>Spotify.NetStandard</strong> has also helped me create a few versions of a <strong>Presentation</strong> about <a href="https://youtu.be/dC6U2uPWk-A" target="_blank">Spotify for Developers</a> along with being the basis of <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com/workshops/blazorfy" target="_blank">Blazorfy</a>
                                        which was a <strong>Workshop</strong> that combined <a href="https://blazor.net" target="_blank">Blazor</a> and <a href="https://spotify.com" target="_blank">Spotify</a>.

                                        This week was pleased to see the video of the two talks for <a href="https://ne-bytes.github.io" target="_blank">NEBytes</a> on <strong>How to move from Manual Testing to Automated Testing with Postman</strong> by Ian Douglas 
                                        and my own on <strong>Microsoft & AI</strong> are now on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2g7uC4UelI" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. I[m pleased the video already has around thirty views as of this post,
                                        so feel free to check it out and catch up with both talks if you missed them! I really enjoyed putting together the <strong>Microsoft & AI</strong> and spent quite a long time putting it together, even updating it an hour
                                        beforehand as things were being announced then that I was able to include!

                                        This week I posted some <a href="../../articles/blazor-games/">Blazor Games</a> which ported across some of the games I had done for <strong>Windows App SDK</strong> to <strong>Blazor</strong>, not only
                                        that while doing this I also learned how to publish the games to <a href="https://rogueplanetoid.github.io/Blazor.Games" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> which was really interesting and something
                                        I will do with <strong>Blazor</strong> examples in the future. I've also made a start on a project using <strong>Blazor</strong> for work as they asked me to present something for their 
                                        <strong>Learning at Work</strong> week they are doing next month, so is great to be doing more <strong>Blazor</strong> again!

                                        I've started writing the fourth <strong>Episode</strong> of the <a href="../../podcast/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> which I can exclusively reveal here will be about <strong>Spotify for Developers</strong> which
                                        is something I've had an interest in over the past few years and is good to cover once more but this time in a <strong>Podcast</strong> and get more developers aware of this service from <strong>Spotify</strong>!

                                        It was great to be back at <a href="https://www.makerspace.org.uk/" target="_blank">Maker Space</a> again yesterday and get started with a project! Mine was to get the <strong>Eaglemoss Vector 3 3D Printer</strong> from the 
                                        <strong>Eaglemoss 3D Create & Print Partwork</strong> working again after being unused for a few years. My 3D printer had been well looked after and was only a little 
                                        dusty on the top but with a bit of a clean and checking of a few components I was able to breathe life into it again, after locating the software which took
                                        a bit of time as the publishers and the website for the partwork were long gone. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I was able to remove the filament that had been left within the extruder the past few years once I was able to connect and command the software to heat it up and retract the piece. 
                                        The rest of the filament itself was not able to be used, as it was degraded after so much time, but I was able to load up the 3D printer with some brand-new filament and will be ready to do a 
                                        test print on my next visit to <strong>Maker Space</strong>!

                                        This week was the first week in a while that might have had no events to go to if it hadn't been for <a href="https://www.makerspace.org.uk/" target="_blank">Maker Space</a> having their first Welcome Wednesday in their new 
                                        Gateshead home! It was great to be in <strong>Maker Space</strong> again and wrote an <strong>Article</strong> about <a href="../../articles/maker-space/" target="_blank">Maker Space</a> that features some photographs I took of the new place. 
                                        It was great to see everyone there  and chat to people I'd not seen for years and soon seemed like no time had passed since the last time I had been there over three years ago, 
                                        looking forward to going to <strong>Maker Space</strong> again soon!

                                        1st of April was April Fool's Day but you wouldn't have been a fool for checking out the latest <strong>Episode</strong> of the <a href="../../podcast">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> about <a href="../../podcast/episode-three">Microsoft & AI</a>, 
                                        it was great to put this <strong>Episode</strong> together and cover this topic more, after doing my presentation about it at <a href="../../articles/nebytes-march-2023/">NEBytes</a> 
                                        was good to talk a little more about it, things are changing so fast in that space as the episode had extra bits recorded after the initial recording right up to the day before it was released! 
                                        Talking of podcasts was very pleased to see that my wife's podcast, <a href="https://www.scottishmurders.com/" target="_blank">Scottish Murders</a>, had been shortlisted for <strong>Best Indie Podcast</strong> at the 
                                        <a href="https://truecrimeawards.co.uk/" target="_blank">Inaugural CrimeCon UK True Crime Awards</a> in London this year, so will be great to go along for that in June along with 
                                        <a href="https://www.crimecon.co.uk/" target="_blank">CrimeCon</a> itself a few days later and help represent <strong>Scottish Murders</strong>!

                                        I had submitted a talk to the <a href="https://scottishsummit.com/" target="_blank">Scottish Summit</a> for this year, <strong>How sharing can make you a better developer</strong>, 
                                        for their on-tour event in Manchester, England. However, I was not selected, but the positive thing is I now have an extra session I can attend and from the other talks that did make 
                                        it they all sound interesting so will be tough to pick which ones to attend but know whatever ones I pick I'll learn something from those sessions! There is some good news they are 
                                        doing a Pre-Day YouTube event and have already mentioned I'd like to participate so am pleased people may be able to see the talk beforehand and am looking forward to going along 
                                        to the <strong>Scottish Summit</strong> on the 5th of August!
