                                    <p class="blog-post-meta">30th August 2023</p>

                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Welcome Wednesday</strong> at <a href="https://makerspace.org.uk/" target="_blank">MakerSpace</a> was great with a few new people looking around and 
                                        hopefully some new members to come in and create or work on some amazing new projects. I was able to order and locate the replacement part I needed for my 
                                        <strong>3D Printer</strong> so proceeded to replace the extruder with the brand new one I had received and I also took the opportunity to change the filiment colour 
                                        from blue to white. I also got some new masking tape to put on the heatbed so if a print does get stuck, you can just peel it off, which has worked well in the 
                                        past, well after getting the <strong>3D Printer</strong> back together I was able to get the filiment to come through. Unfortunately, it isn't quite printing 
                                        correctly, even after calibrating it but recall it took a while to get it started in the first place when I first got it working a few years ago so hopefully 
                                        next time I'm there I can get it working!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Welcome Wednesday</strong> is also a great chance to socialise and meet up with the members there, we often go to the pub although that week many were getting 
                                        food in but I and a few others decided to go along to the pub still and had a good chat there too! It is a great opportunity to chat to like-minded people and learn 
                                        about things there so whether it is in <strong>MakerSpace</strong> or Wetherspoons you'll certainly find something interesting to do, or get to see one of the amazing 
                                        projects other people are working on! So, if you can make it to <strong>Gateshead</strong> just next to the <strong>Tyne Bridge</strong> then you'll find 
                                        <strong>MakerSpace</strong> there and can visit on another <strong>Welcome Wednesday</strong>!

                                    <p>
                                        Today I've published another <strong>Article</strong> to help celebrate the <strong>CESPage 25th Anniversary</strong> which is about <a href="../../articles/zune/">Zune</a>,
                                        It seems appropriate to have posted that as have been working on my latest <strong>Presentation</strong> about <strong>Zune</strong> along with <strong>Windows Phone</strong>
                                        which I've written a first draft of the content and will be putting together the slides soon! This post also marks the thirtieth <strong>RoguePlanetoid Weekly Update</strong>,
                                        it is always great to say what I have been doing and what I am up to!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This week it was amazing to post that I have been nominated for the <strong>Community Rising Star Award</strong> at the <a href="https://www.ukcommunityawards.co.uk/" target="_blank">Microsoft Technology UK Community and Partner Awards</a> 
                                        for 2023! I shared this on <strong>LinkedIn</strong> and got an amazing level of support just from that so am hopeful that many of those will consider voting for me when 
                                        voting opens from 1st September and hopefully stand a good chance of making the short-list for the awards! I've never received any awards of any kind for my contributions to the community,
                                        so even being considered will be a first for me and will hopefully represent not just myself but my region - the North East of England! Even if I don't win, I aim to do even more
                                        for the tech community here in the North East of England and hopefully will get along to more events around the country too!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This time next week I will be releasing the next <strong>Episode</strong> of the <a href="../../podcast">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> about <a href="https://www.zunepedia.com" target="_blank">Zunepedia</a>,
                                        although I'm doing it last minute again as haven't finished writing it yet, but will be doing that tomorrow and will also be recording and editing it over the weekend! I've been busy
                                        with a few things recently but am hopefully going to go back to writing, recording and editing my <strong>Podcast</strong> well before release again!

                                        It was another <strong>Welcome Wednesday</strong> at <a href="https://makerspace.org.uk/" target="_blank">MakerSpace</a> and I was able to order a new part for
                                        my <strong>3D Printer</strong> that should arrive by the next time I go along, so should be able to get it back to full working order then and might even switch 
                                        to a different colour of filament by using White instead having previously used Blue and originally Red filament.

                                        It was great to see what other projects people were working on which included some members putting together the <a href="https://www.omenie.com/pipistrelle.html" target="_blank">Pipistrelle</a> bat detector
                                        that I had seen others putting together the last time I had been at <strong>MakerSpace</strong> and was also interested to see another project to flash the board of a 
                                        <strong>Dyson</strong> vaccuum cleaner that is quite sophisticated and used to determine battery status and perform other battery management tasks so get it to work with 
                                        any battery amongst other capabilities similar to those of a Raspberry Pi! It is great to see so many different projects and looking forward to doing something new 
                                        the next <strong>Welcome Wednesday</strong>!

                                        This week I was back at <a href="https://www.makerspace.org.uk/" target="blank">MakerSpace</a> trying to fix my <strong>3D Printer</strong> but it will need some 
                                        replacement parts before it starts printing again, while there it was good to see people putting together the <a href="https://www.omenie.com/pipistrelle.html" target="_blank">Pipistrelle</a> 
                                        which is a bat detector! It will be good to go along next time and maybe try a simpler version of a project and can aim for something like that in the future once I get use to putting 
                                        components together again along with practising soldering first!

                                        This week I've started to pull together bits and pieces for my next presentation about <strong>Zune</strong> and <strong>Windows Phone</strong> and will be making a start on 
                                        writing and putting it together, not only will this be a non-programming topic but will also push my skills as won't be using any speaker notes to deliver the presentation, 
                                        although will have a few slides! I'll also be putting together the next <strong>Episode</strong> of the <a href="../../podcast">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> about <a href="https://www.zunepedia.com" target="_blank">Zunepedia</a> 
                                        so am looking forward to that, is going to be a great month for nostalgia!

                                    <p>
                                        Next week I will be putting together the presentation itself about <strong>Zune</strong> and <strong>Windows Phone</strong>, it is great to collect together a few stories about them,
                                        including some great insights! I'm hoping it will be interesting to those who don't know anything about them as well as anyone who might know something about them too,
                                        I think it will be interesting to both and am looking forward to finishing putting it together, will spend time to make sure it is as good as it can possible be!

                                        It was great to be back at <a href="https://www.makerspace.org.uk/" target="blank">MakerSpace</a> for another <strong>Welcome Wednesday</strong> to attempt to resurrect 
                                        my <strong>3D Printer</strong> after it the last print resulted in the filament becoming tangled up inside. I was able to remove the filament however after a few attempts 
                                        to push anything through the extruder I failed, but thanks to help from Alistair who has more experience and expertise with them than I we were able to remove the extruder 
                                        head but it was blocked too much so will have to source a suitable replacement part for it but hopefully once I do that will get my <strong>3D Printer</strong> working again!                                        
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Since I wasn't able to do much I decided to see what others were working on and was good timing as there was a project available for many of the members there to put together 
                                        which was a Bat Detector with the <a href="https://www.omenie.com/pipistrelle.html" target="_blank">Pipistrelle</a> This used a PCB with the layout for the components required 
                                        including resisters, capacitors, LEDs and a Raspberry Pi along with using solder paste that could be applied and then the components could be placed on the board. This could 
                                        then use a hot plate to connect the components securely to the board. It was amazing to see many of the parts of the process being carried out and even captured a few photos 
                                        of a few of the steps which you can see below:

                                        It may not have been possible to use my <strong>3D Printer</strong> this week at <strong>MakerSpace</strong> but it was amazing to see people putting together their 
                                        own <strong>Pipistrelle</strong>, although such a thing was probably way above my skill level, I think once I got used to a simpler project I might be able to give 
                                        it a go! Remember all are welcome during <strong>Welcome Wednesday</strong> so why not come along next time to <strong>MakerSpace</strong>!

                                        This week I had travelled down to Manchester for <a href="https://scottishsummit.com/" target="_blank">Scottish Summit</a> as it was doing an On Tour Event there.
                                        It was amazing to see how much Manchester had changed since the last time I had been there over a decade ago. Every session was really good and will help me shape 
                                        my own talks and sessions in the future. I'm hopeful to be able to become a speaker at an event such as <strong>Scottish Summit</strong> along with helping 
                                        represent the North East of England which is often underepresented at events in the UK.

                                        Next week I will be writing the next episode of the <a href="../../podcast/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> which will be about <a href="https://www.zunepedia.com" target="_blank">Zunepedia</a>,
                                        which was my project to create a Digital Coffee Table Book about <strong>Zune</strong> which I released almost two years ago and pushed my limited design skills to the limit - and beyond!
                                        It is great to be able to do something for <strong>Zune</strong> again and along with a presentation I am also putting togtether about it and <strong>Windows Phone</strong>,
                                        it is also great to remember the small parts I have played in the history of both those platforms!

                                        If you listened to the latest <strong>Episode</strong> of the <strong>RoguePlanetoid Podcast</strong> about <a href="../../podcast/episode-seven/">Good and Bad Developers</a>,
                                        you may have heard a big difference in the quality and volume of the <strong>Podcast</strong>. This is thanks to the amazing advice from <strong>Jamie Taylor</strong>
                                        who is the host of the newly renamed <a href="https://dotnetcore.show/" target="_blank">The Modern .NET Show</a> which used to be <strong>The .NET Core Show</strong>.
                                        I appreciated the advice of this amazing fellow podcaster and recommend you check out their show with great interview with those in the <strong>.NET</strong> community,
                                        many of which I know of and look up to as a developer. It is great to be part of a community that helps each other and know that help has resulted in a better sounding <strong>Podcast</strong>!

                                        Three Rules of TDD - Robert C. Martin (“Uncle Bob”) provides a concise set of rules for practising TDD:
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Write production code only to pass a failing unit test</li>
                                            <li>Write no more of a unit test than sufficient to fail (compilation failures are failures)</li>
                                            <li>Write no more production code than necessary to pass the one failing unit test.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For this North East Coding Doji was based on the Kata for <a href="https://www.codurance.com/katas/roman-numerals" target="_blank">Roman Numerals</a> which was 
                                        to convert Arabic Numbers into their Roman Numeral equivalents. Often you can follow TDD to a specific goal, but sometimes the knowledge of the 
                                        solution overtakes the tests. If you can't create a failing test, then the solution is complete and you can keep certain tests if they are no longer 
                                        necessary to make sure there are not any regressions later.

                                        to Manchester and the other things I saw before attending the conference and some photographs I took from the day!

                                        It was interesting attending <strong>Scottish Summit</strong> as all the sessions there were informative and well delivered and learned a few things,
                                        including how I can improve my own talks in future along with other things I'll probably need to know about in the future, so it certainly was worth going 
                                        there and will be good to put some of those things into practice.

                                        This week saw the release of the latest <strong>Episode</strong> of the <a href="../../podcast">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> about <a href="../../podcast/episode-seven">Good and Bad Developers</a>
                                        where I shared some stories I had heard about, experienced myself or been told by colleagues but with names excluded and details changed about good and bad developers! I'm hoping it will
                                        inspire debate and help encourage people to be good developers and discourage them from being bad ones. Although it was another late recording and editing for that one so the next <strong>Episode</strong>
                                        will hopefully avoid that!

                                        This week I travelled down to Glasgow to help out with something that was happening there, can't say what it was just yet, other than to say it wasn't the <strong>UCI World Cycling Championships</strong>
                                        which started the same day, as it turned out, so were glad had took the train as many roads were closed! Continuing the Scottish theme, as this is posted I'll be in Manchester for
                                        the <a href="https://www.scottishsummit.com/" target="_blank">Scottish Summit</a> which is happening this Saturday but you can already check out the talk I did for their <strong>YouTube</strong> Channel which
                                        was about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScKslAgCZQE">How Sharing Can Make You A Better Developer</a>. I'm really looking forward to checking out the sessions and meeting people there!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Next week I'll be starting work on a brand-new presentation about <strong>Zune</strong> and <strong>Windows Phone</strong> which will push my abilities as a speaker to the maximum and hopefully be a great learning
                                        experience that I can apply back to doing ones about software development! Luckily those two things are something I know a lot about anyway and have even played my part in both in some way!
                                        This month I'm also looking forward to putting together the next <strong>Episode</strong> of the <strong>RoguePlanetoid Podcast</strong>, it will celebrate the second anniversary
                                        of <a href="https://www.zunepedia.com" target="_blank">Zunepedia</a> with a companion episode to the digital coffee table book I released in 2021. It is hard to believe it was two years ago
                                        that it was released and look forward to adding an audio element to the rich photography and designs that I featured back then!
