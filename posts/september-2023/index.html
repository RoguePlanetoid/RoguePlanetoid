                                    <p>
                                        This week had recovered from being ill so it was time to work on the <a href="../../podcast/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a>! Indeed, the past few months I have left it to near the end of the month,
                                        but this month when I had intended to not do that, but this time I had to wait until I felt better to be able to do it, which meant it happening at the end of the month again, will be interesting to see if 
                                        I can write, record and edit an <strong>Episode</strong> well before the end of next month! The upcoming <strong>Episode</strong> will be about <strong>.NET 8</strong> covering a few things I've mentioned
                                        on the <strong>Podcast</strong> before but with some up-to-date information!

                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This week it was announced I'll be doing a talk at <a href="https://www.devhubnorth.com/" target="_blank">DevHub North</a>, this is one of the most popular user groups in the North East and there will be two talks.
                                        Mine will be <strong>Blazor a trail with .NET 8</strong> which ties nicely into the <strong>Episode</strong> of the <a href="../../podcast/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> about <strong>.NET 8</strong>
                                        and will include a demo that actually may come in handy for something, which I'll reveal at at talk. The other talk will be <strong>Agile IT Architecture Design: Building Efficient and Effective Systems for AWS and Beyond</strong>
                                        by <strong>Gary Brown</strong> from <strong>AND Digital</strong>. So if you want to come along then the event will be at <strong>TusPark</strong> in Newcastle upon Tyne on the 10th of October from 5:30pm!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Next month I'll be at the <strong>Microsoft Build: AI Day</strong> in London at <strong>ExCel</strong> on the 19th of October, I'm really looking forward to seeing the sessions and getting a chance to see many people from Microsoft
                                        in person along with meeting up with anyone else who may be there, I'll be covering everything right here with an <strong>Article</strong> about the event. I also really appreciate that my employer 
                                        <a href="https://www.bedegaming.com" target="_blank">Bede Gaming</a> is covering the costs of attending as I'd probably not have been able to go otherwise, so a bit thankyou to them!
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        You may have noticed there hasn't been a <strong>RoguePlanetoid Weekly Update</strong> for a while! Seems you can have plans then something happens that puts them out of action! 
                                        I got a summer flu so haven't been able to do many of the things I had planned to such as I was unable to make it to <strong>HaintonDotNet</strong>,
                                        I had been really looking forward to this one as there were multiple speakers but am looking forward to being able to watch a recording of the talks 
                                        so won't miss out completely! We were also unable to go to <a href="https://www.crimecon.co.uk/" target="_blank">CrimeCon</a> to help represent 
                                        <a href="https://scottishmurders.com/" target="_blank">Scottith Murders</a>, but aiming to make it back there next year and to the one in London!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This month saw those shortlisted for the <a href="https://www.ukcommunityawards.co.uk/" target="_blank">Microsoft Technology UK Community and Partner Awards</a>,
                                        unfortunately I didn't make it in my category <strong>Community Rising Star Award</strong> nor did a lot of people I know, so looks like the judges had some tough 
                                        choices to make, but it was good to be at least considered and hoping to do more in the community in the next few weeks and months, especially now I'm feeling better!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Next week I'll be finishing off my talk about <strong>Zune</strong> and <strong>Windows Phone</strong> which is called <strong>A beginning of an end & An end of a beginning</strong>.
                                        Also happy to say I'm doing another talk which will be about <strong>Blazor</strong> and also cover a few other things and have already started on the demo, which is actually something useful, 
                                        but it feels good to be working on putting together some talks again!
                                    </p>

                                        Which was their vision for connected entertainment that started with the original Zune, now more famous for appearing in <strong>Guardian's of the Galaxy Vol. 3</strong>.

                                        <strong>Zunepedia</strong> was a massive undertaking and involved taking advantage of assets that I had collected during the heyday of <strong>Zune</strong> along with some amazing contributions
                                        from the community, without which <strong>Zunepedia</strong> would not have been possible! It is fantastic to look back over the two years since it was released, and thanks to it I appeared on

                                        Today you'll find the latest <a href="../../podcasts/episode-eight">Episode</a> of the <a href="../../podcast">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> about 
                                        <a href="https://www.zunepedia.com" target="_blank">Zunepedia</a>, which was a digital coffee table book about <strong>Zune</strong>, an 
                                        unofficial photographic journey of the history of the Zune devices, hardware, services and the community that keeps it alive to this day, 
                                        that I released back in 2021! It is amazing to think it was two years ago that I released that and to mark that with an <strong>Episode</strong> 
                                        of my <strong>Podcast</strong> about it! This week I've also been writing and putting together a talk that I will be doing in the near future about 
                                        <strong>Zune</strong> and <strong>Windows Phone</strong> so I'm really looking forward to presenting it!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This week I was at a couple of events, my regular visit to <a href="https://makerspace.org.uk/" target="_blank">MakerSpace</a> to get my 
                                        <strong>3D Printer</strong> working again although I still have a bit to go there. I also visited to a new event for me, <strong>Silicon Summer</strong> 
                                        part of the <strong>Silicon Mingle</strong> events that have been running in the North East recently, it was amazing to speak to everyone there and really enjoyed
                                        hearing about what people were doing and also how we can showcase what's happening here in the North East to a wider audience as well as learning I wasn't 
                                        the only <strong>Windows Phone</strong> developer in the North East back in the day, and maybe there were probably more in the North East than any other area!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Next week I'll be still working on my presentation about <strong>Zune</strong> and <strong>Windows Phone</strong>, it is going to be a talk unlike anything I 
                                        have delivered before and will really push my skills as a speaker, along with hopefully transferring those skills to other talks I do and to not only improve 
                                        my developer talks but get into more events that many of my peers and those I look up to present at! I'm already thinking about what my next talk will be, and 
                                        it will be a developer one covering <strong>Windows App SDK</strong> as that's something I've spoken about on my own <strong>Podcast</strong> as well as on an 
                                        upcoming episode of another one for someone else that I can't wait to hear what people think when it is released next week!

                                        <strong>Silicon Summer</strong> was the latest <a href="https://siliconmingle.com/" target="_blank">Silicon Mingle</a> events being held 
                                        in the North East recently and I was finally able to make it along to The Backyard Bike Shop where I was among the first couple of people 
                                        there. It was amazing to see so many people I'd never met or knew before that night and am sure many if not all will be people I will speak 
                                        to and see again as it was amazing to hear about what people were doing, whether that be having done a podcast in the past, having all the 
                                        kit and be ready to go for one - which I encouraged them to do so, a company that recently switched from PHP to C#! Along with many more 
                                        including someone who had a very similar developer experience to myself and even found out that I might not have been so alone in the 
                                        Windows Phone developer world here in in the North East that I had realised! It was great to learn so much about not only back then but 
                                        brought things right up-to-date with what people were working on and doing!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There were so many people I spoke to  at <strong>Silicon Summer</strong> and was also great to hear that I'm not alone in thinking the North East 
                                        has an amazing tech community, aptly demonstrated by the dozens of people who had turned up for <strong>Silicon Summer</strong>, and was the largest non-conference 
                                        event I have been to in over half a decade! Not only that many there also believed that we don't show the rest of the country what is going on in 
                                        the North East, I've watched the North East Tech community grow over the past couple of decades and attended many of the events here in the past 
                                        and recently too that show what we are doing for people already here, but it would be great for more people to see what we are doing and am really 
                                        looking forward to seeing if something comes of going along! There are events you know will inspire and create new opportunities and it was clear 
                                        yesterday was one of those times. I'm excited of the prospects ahead for the North East Tech Community and will continue to do my bit to showcase 
                                        our amazing region and looking forward to making it to the next <strong>Silicon Mingle</strong>!
