                                    <p>
                                        This week and the end of last week was in London for the <a href="https://truecrimeawards.co.uk/" target="_blank">CrimeCon UK True Crime Awards</a> and 
                                        <a href="https://www.crimecon.co.uk/" target="_blank">CrimeCon London</a> as was there helping to represent my wife's <strong>Podcast</strong> of <a href="https://www.scottishmurders.com" target="_blank">Scottish Murders</a>.
                                        Although it didn't win <strong>Best Indie Podcast</strong> it was great to be at the awards and also at the conference where I had some cards for the <a href="../podcast">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a>
                                        that surprisingly a few people either knew someone who was interested or was interested themselves which was an unexpected bonus as it was meant to be for <strong>True Crime</strong>!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I've not worked on anything of my own last week or this week but this weekend I'll be writing the sixth <strong>Episode</strong> of the <strong>RoguePlanetoid Podcast</strong>
                                        which as mentioned last week will be about <a href="https://www.blazor.net" target="_blank">Blazor</a> but will also be doing something else next week which I can't wait to talk about once I am able to!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Next week it will be <a href="https://technext.co.uk/" target="_blank">TechNExt</a> which is the <strong>Tech Festival for the North East</strong> unfortunately many of the events are during the day but am
                                        hoping to get along to a couple of them at least. One I will be going to is the one organised by <strong>Hainton</strong> which should be interesting, there are also some that will be made
                                        available online so will be able to catch up with those. These are mostly top-tier events so didn't get involved in any other way but hopefully should something like this happen again,
                                        hopefully will be the kind of person who would be able to present or talk at this kind of event in the future!

                                        so that will be keeping me busy this week so there will be no <strong>Weekly Update</strong> but am looking forward to that and <strong>CrimeCon UK True Crime Awards</strong>,

                                    <p>
                                        This week saw the release of the latest <a href="../../podcast/episode-five/">Episode</a> of the <a href="../../podcast/">RoguePlanetoid Podcast</a> which was about <strong>Microsoft Build 2023</strong>. 
                                        It was a really interesting conference and was good to give my overview of the keynotes and sessions, I also think I imitated the cadence of Panos Panay when talking about his part of the keynote, 
                                        I found that one really compelling and was a great one to watch but also great to relay as part of the podcast. An additional challenge was I have a cold so didn't quite sound the same as usual 
                                        along with having to write, record and edit the Episode in just a few day which was much harder to do than expected, but don't expect to do an <strong>Episode</strong> that close to release again!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This week I will also finishing and recording my talk <strong>How sharing can make you a better developer</strong> for <a href="https://scottishsummit.com/" target="_blank">Scottish Summit</a> which 
                                        will be released on their <strong>YouTube</strong> channel closer to the conference. It has been really interesting writing it and used the style of the slides to my advantage, it will have some great 
                                        points but also some other things too which I hope will make it more interesting, so hoping it might inspire some debate, looking forward to completing and recording it!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The next thing I will be working on will be <a href="https://www.blazor.net" target="_blank">Blazor</a> for the next <strong>Episode</strong> of the <strong>RoguePlanetoid Podcast</strong> and there will also be a companion <strong>Article</strong>.
                                        I'll also be putting together my very first talk on <strong>Blazor</strong> as have done <strong>Workshops</strong> but not a dedicated <strong>Presentation</strong>, 
                                        also I want to present it at a new event, so if there's a user group out there or online event then let me know on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/rogueplanetoid" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and I'll see if 
                                        I can present it there!
                                    </p>
