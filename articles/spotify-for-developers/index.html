                                        Spotify for Developers is supported by many developers and this includes third-party SDKs that make integrating Spotify functionality such as authorisation and access to the 
                                        endpoints even easier. <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Spotify.NetStandard" target="_blank">Spotify.NetStandard</a> available on Nuget is a package written by 
                                        me that allows .NET developers to take advantage of the Spotify Web API in their applications using the latest version of .NET. This could be in the browser with Blazor, 
                                        on mobile with .NET MAUI or on the desktop with Windows App SDK and it is possible to down-level to .NET Framework 4.8 if needed. Full source code is available on GitHub

                                        companion to this article. My aim is to get more developers using Spotify for Developers in their applications this could be .NET developers using third-parry libraries like 
                                        Spotify.NetStandard, JavaScript developers using the Web Playback SDK or for other platforms where SDKs may be available or create an implementation themselves using 
                                        Spotify for Developers.
