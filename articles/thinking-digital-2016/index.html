                            VRTGO Conference - once of the largest AR/VR conference on 3rd November in Baltic Art Gallery with international speakers and exhibitors and companies such as Unity, 
                            Samsung Gear VR and ARM.

                        <h4>Vector 76 - Shaun Allan</h4>                      
                        <p>
                            Started seven years ago as a development studio in VR with Second Life building objects and environments in this, came from Eutechnyx and brought their skills to 
                            Second Life and was tasked to build a virtual version of local school. After that began to do visualisation work for Zero Carbon Futures, part of Nissan. Did some 
                            work for Bede's World and are currently in talks to revamp work they did for them once that facility re-opens. Also worked on smaller projects such as Road Respect 
                            in 2014 and build an Augmented Reality app for them and made the store front of a shop a target for augmented reality, the car would crash through the store-front 
                            window as part of the experience, in the store were three screens to make up a driving experience and bringing that kit around wasn't very easy. For the following year
                            they did an Oculus DK2 version of driving simulator experience for Road Respect in 2015, there were two modes a normal mode and an affected by drugs/drink mode that 
                            altered experience and framerate, which was the first of it's kind in the UK, installed into a minibus to make it more portable, also helped make the social engagement 
                            increase for the client and helped improve driving experience for users.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Hammerhead VR - Christian Frausig</h4>
                        <p>
                            Been around for three years and focus entirely on VR and work with agencies to develop brand experiences for clients, they work on their own projects too. Their team 
                            is mostly games people and experience with game engines and related technologies, also have people from VFX and Film expertise who also bring in some innovative 
                            techniques like photogramity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They also use the Kinect to capture motion with some of their experiences, they also do facial capture with cameras and motion capture. They have done a few things in VR, 
                            they did a proof of concept of a SuperYacht Visualiser as a sales tool - is a real time product visualisation and can show off customisation features and customisations 
                            available. Also worked on a 360 degree criving experience for Lexus which allowed people to feel they were sitting in the car, using captured video and need to create an 
                            experience that was quite fluid, to create 360 camera content doesn't require any specialist or CG knowledge and can also use a minimum amount of kit to capture the content, 
                            the resolution of these videos is quite low but Youtube are working on improving quality and framerate and can even do 3D 360 videos too.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Did Boursin Sensorium for the Cheese brand and make their brand more fun, did a fun sensory experience to show at food festivals and quite a surreal rollercoaster type 
                            experience, but was sharable and could share 6 seconds of footage to share with friends, got 100,000 views of video and had 5,000 people visiting event and 8,000 people 
                            downloading via Oculus Share.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Did Thunderhead experience for a web analytics company and is difficult to explain to people and wanted to show something at a festival of marketing, wanted an ice breaker 
                            experience with something to talk about and the client were very happy with it and was quite a successful if not abstract campaign. Did a Kitchen of the future concept shown 
                            off at CES as a physical experience but also wanted a virtual version of this experience to show off the possibilities, the physical version didn't work but luckily the 
                            virtual version worked perfectly!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Projects take around two - four months, but longest projects take around five months to build for the longest experiences, need to have enough time to make people feel 
                            immersed but not too long so it feels uncomfortable, so around two-three minutes is the sweet spot for experiences.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Build a VR adaptation of a short film done to get attention from movie makers and want new ways to engage with fans and media, allow people to feel part of the experience - 
                            the movie is being sold to MGM and there will be PR, it will be released on Oculus Share and Steam Store for VIVE and PS VR store when available.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Their IP gets released on all the platforms to aim at all possible users, PlayStation VR has lower specs so have to optimise for that platform compared to the PC platforms - 
                            there are more standards and built in support from game engines to make things easier and more consistent.                        
                        </p>
                        <h4>Chronicles VR - Rachel Derbyshire</h4>
                        <p>
                            Been working in heritage and museum sector primarily but will be working on more commercial projects but have a lot of experience of building experiences for a wide range 
                            of age groups. They build for HTC Vive, Gear VR, Oculus, Google Cardboard and others. Offer 3D development with CGI and game engines and work with 360 films and videos.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Introducing VR is quite a challenge to those companies who are more used to “apps”, they can capture 360 video and capture binaural audio to give the best experience of 
                            feeling like being at the event being recorded, easy to capture live events as CG videos everything has to be created, just need to set up the camera and make sure that 
                            camera crew isn't in shot is challenge instead, they can capture in 4K and build a rig with multiple GoPros with bit of tape to successfully capture content.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They did a Viking installation and work from research and illustrations and recreate elements from these, also to Photogrammetry, 3D scanning and modelling of actual pots 
                            for the Great North Museum and can see how they were used with the experience. They did a V&A Workshop about working with game engines and photogrammetry and allowed people 
                            to see the scope and scale of what VR and AR can do.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They also built experiences with the Make it Digital event with the BBC in 2015 and demoed the various VR experiences they build and had over 200 people check out the content 
                            with a wide range of age groups and abilities who were all able to take part, able to achieve cross-generational experiences. People have engaged with content in VR and made 
                            people excited to go and find the actual artefact depicted once they had completed the experience, something curators have been wanting people to do for decades.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Build AR experiences to show Ships on the Tyne and Zeppelins over the Tyne, although was a project that didn't happen but would allow people to experience these events on the 
                            Tyne, although didn't get past development stage, allowed people to experience a piece of history in a unique way with Augmented Reality.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Evaluation - survey the requirement of location and propose solutions, Capture - principle filming and scanning, Production - bulk of work, Implementation - putting in the work 
                            into an environment. All 360 video is a video wrapped around a sphere and can be viewed on YouTube or Facebook but can build a standalone viewer but this does take additional 
                            development time if needed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Do Mobile VR and setup - have done VR theatres with phones and Google Cardboard, which is also good as a marketing tool and can be simply handed out and branded up as needed. 
                            Can only do from the neck with mobile VR due to limitations of hardware. Tethered VR allows for more wide range of experience - HTC Vive allows you to move around and explore 
                            a virtual space with the headset, but are still tethered to a PC, but allows them to do higher end content.

                            The AIDs Information Trojan from the 80's - this was the first ever random Trojan ever found, that asks for money to get data back down - it purported to tell you risk 
                            of getting HIV, if you didn't pay for the app it would lock the PC and demand payment to Panama in 1989. The Petya MBR  ransom Trojan from 2016 looks about the same 
                            and is the same problem from 1989, which is infected via an email attachment, the email mentions an invoice for a payment that is attached which is a Microsoft Word 
                            Document and when Macros are enabled this allows the system to be infected by the malware - don't enable content - don't click that button as this will infect system

                            If you pay the ransom - they will give you your data back, at least they are honest criminals and it's easy to look up where people have been hit with ransomware and 
                            people state their experience about how they unlocked their files, the gangs behind the ransomware are businessman, they do understand that they need to make money. 
                            Most of the victims are consumers, there's so much competition on Windows so other platforms are targeted such as OS-X, there's only one that does this so it makes 
                            perfect business sense to do this, it even finds the Time Machine servers for Mac to also encrypt those backup files, Bitcoin tends to be the main mechanism to pay 
                            the ransoms for these, it's possible to see what payments were made by examining the block chain to see the amounts of money - €300 million of revenues has gone 
                            through one of these wallets and they don't even have to pay tax, as a criminal.

                            microwave and toasters. The new kinds of risk the internet has exposed us to are great but it has brought so much good and the downsides still make it worthwhile 
                            but hopefully this will apply to IoT. They regularly scan the entire IPv4 address space and control devices that shouldn't be connected to the internet with no

                            The most common attacks are criminal attacks - 95% of malware submissions are from them, but the rest are from other kind of attackers such as terrorists and 
                            nation states. Have seen headlines about Cyberwar, every time there is an attack somewhere and a nation state is suspected “cyberwar” will be mentioned, most 
                            of the attacks from nation states are for espionage/spying and this isn't war - if it's not war it shouldn't be referred to as such. Russia did an attack on 
                            Ukraine involving an attack on the power infrastructure by turning off power and relays, which had to be reenabled manually as the control systems had been 
                            overwritten, the attack had started six weeks earlier - by using the enable content vector from before.

                            Change is unrelenting and everything and everyone is connected anywhere and anytime. Technology embedded in everything we do and we are becoming increasingly 
                            embedded in everything technology does, everything as a service, data about everything.

                            Business thinks Digital = Technology but it's Digital = Business & Mindset, it's about moving away about the technology delivery mindset to business delivery mindset. 
                            The problem starts with the sales process - the sale people tend not to understand the product they are selling. The success rate of projects is about 30% and annual 
                            cost of failure in $100 billions, tend to lack user engagement or accountability, people keep doing the same things and fail in the same way, and it's only going to 
                            get worse, companies only have a basic grasp of value of digital.

                            The “AHA” moment, how organisations are structured is important about strategic planning and management - it's about technology enabled change, the benefits realisation 
                            approach was developed to help manage technology projects. Digital ecosystem and other actors - a time of disruption, some industries may face extinction, change is 
                            increasingly complex. Automation Era, Information Era, Transformation Era, now in the Exploration Era - don't know where we're we are going. Automation is simple/ordered 
                            with best practices, Information & transformation is complicated with proven practices and exploration is complex and has emerging practices.

                            The challenge of value - the major contributor to business value is not the tech itself but it's the organisational change that tech both shapes and enables, all this 
                            gives rise to fundamental rethink of how digital businesses are governed lead and managed - need to go beyond “tweaking”. People say they didn't get value they expected 
                            but then when asked they didn't know what the expectations should have been. Ask where you are and find out how to get back on course, have a different outcome of 
                            give up - that's governance, moment something is going differently need to do something then not wait until later, managing an uncertain journey to an uncertain or 
                            unknown destination.

                            Too many organisations still fail to understand and apply tech effectively, need to get away from industrial governance in a digital world, need a value-focused data 
                            and analytics driven, agile, sense and respond approach to governance. Digital leadership - genuine employee involvement remains an unusual phenomenon, most leaders 
                            don't think in terms of getting voluntary followers they think of control.

                            within which we live and work, the industrial era organisation is now a hindrance, not a support to creating and sustaining individual business and societal value. 
                            Digital organisations require more agile and inclusive approach to governance, leadership, and management, letting people use their brains - leadership can come from 
                            anywhere and we all need to show leadership.

                            received and responded to and there are subconscious layers to these kinds of interactions such as Confidentiality - when we enter sensitive data we hope that no-one is 
                            looking at this. Integrity - when we buy things, we hope the products satisfy some kind of level of integrity. Data democracy - as individuals we are generating huge 
                            volumes of data about ourselves and this data tells a lot about who you are, and therefore would like a say in how this data is being used or how it's dealt with behind

                            How can we support this transparency with the idea of a block chain? Which is the architecture that underlies the Bitcoin currency system. How to services find musicians, 
                            they use an intermediate company such as BMI, PRS so that the correct person can be paid for their music and are trusting these organisations to make sure this is done correctly. For confidentiality the need for the intermediate is another level and layer of trust. Data consumers – data gateways & interfaces – data producers. The gateway to be used needs to be picked, the volume of data isn’t the issue as computers can be scaled, it’s the complexity and diversity of interfaces which is the issue and have to deal with subtleties and differences, there seems to be no way to avoid the middle process. Blockchains are a distributed open, transparent record in the middle instead and also brings in accountability as can easily be examined easily.

                            any intervention, the information can be submitted to this ledger and responded to from it, removes the need to trust an extra company. Move from siloed proprietary system,

                            How they use technology to add to their work and their music. In 1994 a friend introduced them to music that blew them away, they had been playing for five years but was 
                            first time they'd heard synthesisers and wanted to get their drums to sound like dance music but they didn't have the technology to do this, it took 13 years to get the 
                            knowledge to create the music they wanted to create. When reach the limitation of the technology it makes you be creative, and it can allow a wider range of expression, 
                            can push what can do with it can produce an interesting result. Have to be innovative to do new things, the main innovation was manipulation of audio such as sampling to 
                            allow them to play dance music on their drums.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The technology is facilitating but the limitations are making them innovate, they don't want to just play a drum break they can play this with just one hand by allowing 
                            the technology to handle most of the elements and add the parts they can in real-time. Technology has facilitated their vision and allowed them to do what they want, 
                            whatever technology they use it's their own limitations as a player, your limitations can give you that spark of creativity and can show where you've got to.

                            associated with disease vs healthy, do a protein separation using electricity and stuff, get computer to do clever stats to see what is changing significantly between

                            tried before to make it done the right way, which was for them to do it the “right” way themselves - developed diagnostics for Prostate, Renal and Bladder Cancer which 
                            have passed their own blind tests and are in a clinical trial - has taken 8 years rather than 9 months initially thought and will probably take ten years in total to complete.

                                    Focus on the user - within Google and the digital realm this has a deeper sense, focus on adoption the monetisation will follow, start off on 
                                    focusing on the user even if not sure where the monetisation comes from. Android is free open source operating system, there is a lot of money 
                                    being invested into the product, even from the beginning when they invested in it as a start-up. Google doesn't make any money from Android 
                                    directly but they make a lot of money from the Play store, which is the easiest way of getting applications but that wasn't built into the plan, 
                                    figuring out how to make money came later.
                                    Amazon doesn't make their profits from ecommerce but realised it has a lot of infrastructure as it had to have sufficient power for its 
                                    spike needs but could rent that capacity out the rest of the time, and created the public cloud service and build upon the needs of the 
                                    users this was built and the monetisation comes from those using this infrastructure rather than ecommerce. Digital businesses can be 
                                    scaled unlike a physical business to support more customers, support the ability to grow without initial monetisation.

                                    What's the 10x - is Larry Page's favourite question, judging when Google invests in a new product. Thinking outside the box is an unpopular phrase which 
                                    generates ideas which are no use. In what way is the product better, is it 10x cheaper, 10x better, 10x quicker etc - in what way is it better in concrete 
                                    numbers, can work from making something 10x something and work backwards to how you would get there. It's just the right amount of conceivable innovation 
                                    that forces you to change assumptions.

                                    Launch and iterate - the distinguishing feature of innovative technology is that it's new - you don't know what you're doing and will be a lot about it 
                                    you don't know, product an early version as soon as possible is key as it forces you to solve lots of problems including lots you didn't know existed. 
                                    Other aspect of innovative technologies is that they are high risk and lots of them might fail, investing lots of resources up front probably means have 
                                    spent too much money on it or waited too long to launch, need to get it out first to get mass adoption - idea of minimum viable product - figure out what 
                                    this is that can be done as soon as possible that delivers some benefit to the user, what matters is that one crucial improvement, such as Google Docs 
                                    which was launched in a more basic and less perfect form and solved the pain of sharing and using documents in a browser. The Chrome Web browser which 
                                    is now the most popular web-browser in the world, the first version initially had two key benefits it would auto-update and it was incredibly fast, 
                                    the first version was just a window launched to the team and it had an auto update mechanism, the figured out how to make it show a webpage and use 
                                    the auto update feature to add this to allow more and more features to the browser, if you're producing a product you better use it and it was good 
                                    enough for this then later for everyone.

                            It requires a lot of discipline as a produce manager to keep to these core values, things can get cancelled if they don't work out - but that's okay as 
                            whatever is done next will be great, have to deal with feedback and understand what the user is doing every day of the week - it's not all Free Sushi and 
                            Nap Pods, although they do have them, it's a lot of hard work to stick to those principles.

                            has on our health. It has something to do with gut, is to do with the large intestine - the colon, many places in the body have a microbiome these can be 
                            encountered in many places outside the body too, these microbiomes are made up of organisms are too small to see and are really well adapted to live in the 
                            gut and not outside. The environment in the colon it is very different and to grow them from samples was difficult to do in the lab without the correct conditions. 
                            Scientists weren't aware of what strains of organism would be able to live in the colon as couldn't really see them until recently.

                            Genetic sequencing allows to see what organisms are present without having to grow them, they don't have to be alive just need the genetic signature to see which ones 
                            were present, similar to the early days of naturalists exploring the world, were seeing the diversity of micro-organisms that were present in the body. Our health may 
                            depend on these bacteria, mental wellbeing and even behaviour may be influenced by their presence. Gut wall is one cell thick and the bacteria there helps make sure 
                            things stay inside, these non-human cells are tolerated which has occurred through the process of evolution. Serotonin is produced primarily in the gut so the environment 
                            there is important for the production of these and the communicate from the gut to the brain via the nervous system.

                            It's possible to transplant the gut microbes from a healthy person into a sick person and although sounds primitive worked in over 90% of patients and brought people back 
                            to health so well the trial was ended early so all could benefit from the treatment it was that effective, the donors are carefully screened and selected. However it could 
                            be possible to culture the microbes and implant these instead in a more refined manner - it's already possible to find out the organisms that are in the gut using a sample 
                            and find out who's in your gut, might even be possible in future to have a toilet that could indicate what organisms are present showing current microbial profile and what 
                            might be missing and could supplement this where necessary similar to probiotic yogurts but these organisms aren't well evolved to survive in the gut so need to eat them 
                            regularly.

                            People eat a lot of fermented produce, foods and sauces and contain organisms that their favourite thing to eat is fibre such as pre-biotic fibres which can't be digested 
                            by our body but only by bacteria that live in the gut, and these organisms deliver things that the body needs in response, some of the fermented products deliver live 
                            microbes but not all. To see any benefits, you have to eat these foods constantly and have to be an integral part of daily life, doesn't matter if they don't stay long in 
                            the gut as are always eating them and they are cultured in barrels or vessels they are made with and environment they're prepared in.

                            She's an analogue native, whereas many people were born thinking digitally - had to do social media on a rotary phone with Mum listening! Everyone has something to believe in, 
                            rail against and talk about. The benefit of all the experience and time in the industry is a perspective of the three major waves - Silicon Valley, dot com bubble and bust 
                            and the rise of social media.

                            In order to look forward we need to look back, history has a lot to tell us, there's a bed rock of certain truths that always emerge and remain and a story to be told. 
                            In the early 80s they worked in an advertising agency in Silicon Valley with tech companies such as Apple and Atari when they were smaller - they mostly dealt with the 
                            founders of the company to discuss the branding such as Steve Jobs or Atari's Nolan Bushnell. There's been a lot of change in the last thirty years and to think of all 
                            the change to come in the next thirty years.

                            Early days of Apple, in summer 1983 they had started working in the agency and as welcoming treat they were invited onto a shoot for Apple for the Apple Lisa, they were a 
                            far smaller company there when the Mac was still being developed. The film shoot featured Kevin Costner and a British director Ridley Scott who'd just directed Blade Runner 
                            the year before but was selected to direct these three adverts for the ad, they were give the job to look after Kevin Costner's dog, the dog got to be in the advert as it 
                            kept coming up to him all the time, advert featured line soon there will be two kinds of people those who use computers and those who use Apple's. They met Steve Jobs who 
                            understood the power of communication, even then he was obsessed with innovation before Jony Ive was there, he had a commitment to design and he valued the advertising 
                            agency and made a few of the team insiders in the Mac team and knew had one chance to allow people to see the produce as he saw it as a revolutionary product with it's WYSIWYG 
                            technology and User Experience was very important to him as the technology itself. The Mac was billed as the computer for the rest of us and the product would be launched 
                            with a commercial to be only shown once, during the Super Bowl as a timed advert to coincide with the year 1984 and had a 1984 theme also directed by Ridley Scott, they sat 
                            in the board room when the showing of this advert was being discussed, but Steve and all the advertising people loved the advert and did qualitative research around America 
                            by showing the advert to various people and was given the job of arguing that the advert should be run and would define Apple in the long term and be followed by 
                            conventional marketing - it became a national sensation, and nearly didn't happen.

                            In the years between 1984 and 1985 and met with Steve Jobs quite regularly, it was a different world, it was the world before Steve, the world he made, and the recent film 
                            isn't accurate and portrays Steve as a cold person but their experience was of a hot, highly talkative person who repeated mantras frequently and more like Steve Ballmer 
                            than the Steve Jobs portrayed in the film, John Scully was the cooler person in real life. There were a lot of women who helped influence the company, including those who 
                            helped develop the fonts used by the Apple platform even today and the Macintosh product manager and one who ran the production line, which would be rare even now and 
                            another who was a financial controller for Macintosh. He wasn't a warrior for women's rights just was confused why the talents of 50% of the population would be ignored, 
                            and is unbelievable this was all 30 years ago.

                            If he was still there he might have come up with more and different ideas, although they still are successful company without Steve. She learned that the more things change 
                            the more they stay the same, just because something is popular doesn't make it successful in the long term, but can make ideas the hardest things for other companies to 
                            copy or dislodge - people still read, watch, listen and learn yet discovery and surprise is a welcome as predictability. The disempowerment of brands and the death of 
                            television predicted at the start of the decade hasn't happened. There are arguments about the decline of usability due to overuse of advertising, can brands be like people - 
                            do we want to anthropomorphise brands? What about AI, that is the future - there are different points of view that they will destroy or save us, there are self-driving cars 
                            and other things, luckily those in technology get to share in the future and ideas, like those who came before.
