                        <h4>Search with Bing</h4>
                        <p>
                            Microsoft Bing is the search engine from Microsoft at <a href="https://bing.com" target="_blank">bing.com</a> and was first launched in 2009, although Microsoft had 
                            a search offering before then with Windows Live Search and MSN Search. When searching with Bing you can earn Microsoft Rewards that can be exchanged for gift cards, 
                            prize entries and more.

                            AI is providing compelling content discovery and creation such as <a href="https://chat.openai.com" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a> which was launched by OpenAI near the end of 2022. ChatGPT has proven popular and has changed 
                            the landscape of content creation and discovery by producing humanlike responses from a variety of prompts using a massive dataset.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ChatGPT allows you to get answers to questions and can create material based on human prompts. ChatGPT can remember what has been said in a conversation, allowing for 
                            clarifications and corrections but decline any requests deemed inappropriate. ChatGPT has limited knowledge of events after 2021 and can generate incorrect information, 
                            biased instructions or even harmful content. ChatGPT demonstrates the power of AI in an easy-to-use way on a wide range of topics such as to explain what ChatGPT is.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ChatGPT is part of the category of applications known as Generative AI that do not offer general search capabilities along with Jasper, Stability AI and others. 
                            Then there are search engines or content search such as Bing, Google, Amazon, YouTube and more. What if you could get the best of both worlds with Generative 
                            AI and Search? Bing brings together the best of Generative AI powered by GPT-4 from OpenAI but designed for Search which is then augmented and aided with AI.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Prometheus is a proprietary collection of capabilities and techniques from Microsoft using GPT-4 from OpenAI powering the latest AI features of Bing with improved 
                            relevance of results, up-to-date information along with annotated answers with citations and links. There is also an increased safety of results as Microsoft 
                            understands that AI is not like any other tool and requires principles to make sure it is used ethically and responsibly during training and at runtime and ensure 
                            the model is being engaged with more intelligently.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Prometheus leveraged the power of Bing and GPT-4 to iteratively generate a set of internal queries through the Bing Orchestrator to provide accurate and rich chat answers 
                            for a query within the context of a conversation. Prometheus selects the required internal queries and use the respective Bing results to provide relevant and up-to-date 
                            information, allowing it to answer topical questions, help reduce inaccuracies and the model reasons using data provided by Bing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Prometheus was developed and tested using the OpenAI GPT-4 model itself to identify any potential risks and detect any illegal activities. The process took advantage of 
                            the model's capability to be a realistic conversation simulator, making it possible to conduct thousands of potentially harmful conversations to see how Bing would 
                            respond during development. This process also allowed Prometheus to be continuously tested with a wide range of conversations to see if it is doing the right thing, 
                            identify any defects and allow the system to be updated accordingly. This also allowed for a tight loop of testing, analysing and improvement, which led to significant 
                            innovations from the initial implementation along with assessing how current and relevant information was that was being returned.

                        <p>
                            Chat with Bing allows you to get the complete answers you are looking for. Chat with Bing allows you to ask complex questions and get better answers by providing more details, 
                            clarity and ideas with results that include citations and links that allow you to act on any responses or get creative inspiration with the benefits of Generative AI combined 
                            with the power of search. Chat with Bing supports three conversation styles which can be more Creative where responses are original and imaginative, creating surprise and 
                            entertainment or more Balanced where responses are reasonable and coherent, balancing accuracy and creativity in conversation and more Precise where responses are factual 
                            and concise, prioritising accuracy and relevancy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Chat with Bing allows you to ask any question such as to explain the new Bing and any information is provided with links so you can see where information is coming from, 
                            so if there is something you're not sure of, or you need further details you can use the links to find out more. You can also access the new Bing from the taskbar search 
                            in Windows 11 allowing you to access the world's information and generate content from the Windows taskbar. Bing is also integrated in Skype where it can help you get answers, 
                            creative ideas or summaries in chat. Bing in Skype can provide helpful answers to your questions, whether you need a quick answer or something more in-depth along with being 
                            able to generate ideas or just have fun.
