                        <h3>How to move from Manual Testing to Automated Testing with Postman - Ian Douglas</h3>
                        <p>
                            Postman can be used in the browser and is also an application, most features work in the free account but there are some paid features. 
                            Most people who get started with it are familiar with it being a HTTP client for testing an API where you can send a request out and get 
                            a response back, check if an API works and for testing. Can find out how to run tests and even automate this in the command line as part 
                            of a CI/CD pipeline.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In Postman once a structure of data that has come back you can validate what has come back, what the status code was along with how long 
                            it took to come back. When you first use Postman, you can see the query parameters for a Get request and the Body that can be provided for 
                            the Post request. There are also tests which can be a block of JavaScript code that will be called once a response has been received and 
                            can even create a Pre-request Script to do something beforehand if needed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Postman for the tests has snippets to use to help build up tests such as expectations of the response that should be coming back, such as 
                            the status code being 200 and got a 201 instead for examples, once one test has failed the rest of the tests in JavaScript won't be run and 
                            you can also see if something in the response also has a value that you expect.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Postman uses the Chia JS library for tests and assertions. You can unpack the response and check for attributes and check lengths of values, 
                            along with error conditions and can have multiple tests within Postman in a collection within a workspace which can be for a bunch of requests 
                            to call an API then any collections can be synced to the Postman cloud. You can run all the tests for a collection with the collection runner 
                            including what requests you want to call, how many times to run it along with any delays and you can also inject file data into tests if needed. 
                            Postman will give a report of the tests that have been run and which tests have passed along with an overall status of the duration and average 
                            response time. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Postman allows you to run tests from the command line by using the unique identifier for the collection, you can also have variables resolved 
                            from a collection and there will be a unique identifier for the environment details that can be provided to allow variables to be resolved and 
                            you will also need an API key. Postman CLI is an official closed-source implementation but there is also an open-source library known as Newman 
                            which will continue.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Postman Command Line Interface (CLI) allows you to run and test Postman collections directly from the command line or terminal. You can login by 
                            providing an API key to the Postman CLI and then run a collection and provide the ID for collection and provide the environment id for the variables 
                            and this will run the tests in the collection and will output a report in the terminal including any tests that have failed. You can also customise 
                            the reports and Postman itself will contain any generated reports and allows this to be integrated into a DevOps or CI/CD pipeline.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Postman also allows you to set up a monitor from the collections to monitor a collection which is like a cron job where you can provide a name, tag, 
                            environment along with a data file to be provided to a test, then can provide how often you want to run it such as every week day or just one day of 
                            the week, or can run it every hour, two hours or more often and even run it every five minutes or 30 minutes and can then detect when an API call is 
                            not responding correctly and can have it email when there is a failure but can do this for so many failures so don't get inundated with emails. 
                            You can get started for free but will get more functionality in the paid plan.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Postman also allows you to design an API in Postman and even import a Swagger specification and can work on them within Postman for enterprise customers. 
                            There is a code generator to generate JavaScript, Python and others for a basic framework or scaffold for your API.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Postman also allows for test and automation to set up all sorts of CI/CD pipelines and can synchronise with code repositories and will also integrate 
                            with Azure Pipelines along with GitHub Actions and more. When you change your API Postman will run your CI/CD pipeline for you, so can initiate work 
                            from inside Postman or can synchronise the API through the pipelines and make sure are up-to-date with latest versions and Postman also supports other 
                            integrations for collections including what data to put into CI/CD pipeline.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Postman also supports flows which is a visual programming tool to create the requests you want to create to then do another thing once that request 
                            succeeds or fails, if it does then do something else and parse that response and do another request or if it fails to the log any response and helps 
                            those who aren't programmers to write the tests they need using a visual workflow to work with APIs and this uses AI to assist with the creation of 
                            the flow such as getting the information you need from a request or response and then pass that to another request if needed. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Postman primary use case is to run the tests for a collection and use this as a monitor to see a history of when those ran and then use the command line 
                            interface to run these and find out what ran or not can check for failure conditions you expect or ones that should pass and can write scripts around this 
                            to do more DevOps automation.
                        </p>

                            AI is providing compelling content discovery and creation such as <a href="https://chat.openai.com" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a> which was launched by OpenAI near the end of 2022. ChatGPT has proven popular and has changed 
                            the landscape of content creation and discovery by producing humanlike responses from a variety of prompts using a massive dataset.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ChatGPT allows you to get answers to questions and can create material based on human prompts. ChatGPT can remember what has been said in a conversation, allowing for 
                            clarifications and corrections but decline any requests deemed inappropriate. ChatGPT has limited knowledge of events after 2021 and can generate incorrect information, 
                            biased instructions or even harmful content. ChatGPT demonstrates the power of AI in an easy-to-use way on a wide range of topics such as to explain what ChatGPT is.

                            ChatGPT is part of the category of applications known as Generative AI that do not offer general search capabilities along with Jasper, Stability AI and others. 
                            Then there are search engines or content search such as Bing, Google, Amazon, YouTube and more. What if you could get the best of both worlds with Generative 
                            AI and Search? Bing brings together the best of Generative AI powered by GPT-4 from OpenAI but designed for Search which is then augmented and aided with AI.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Prometheus is a proprietary collection of capabilities and techniques from Microsoft using GPT-4 from OpenAI powering the latest AI features of Bing with improved 
                            relevance of results, up-to-date information along with annotated answers with citations and links. There is also an increased safety of results as Microsoft 
                            understands that AI is not like any other tool and requires principles to make sure it is used ethically and responsibly during training and at runtime and ensure 
                            the model is being engaged with more intelligently.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Prometheus leveraged the power of Bing and GPT-4 to iteratively generate a set of internal queries through the Bing Orchestrator to provide accurate and rich chat answers 
                            for a query within the context of a conversation. Prometheus selects the required internal queries and use the respective Bing results to provide relevant and up-to-date 
                            information, allowing it to answer topical questions, help reduce inaccuracies and the model reasons using data provided by Bing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Prometheus was developed and tested using the OpenAI GPT-4 model itself to identify any potential risks and detect any illegal activities. The process took advantage of 
                            the model's capability to be a realistic conversation simulator, making it possible to conduct thousands of potentially harmful conversations to see how Bing would 
                            respond during development. This process also allowed Prometheus to be continuously tested with a wide range of conversations to see if it is doing the right thing, 
                            identify any defects and allow the system to be updated accordingly. This also allowed for a tight loop of testing, analysing and improvement, which led to significant 
                            innovations from the initial implementation along with assessing how current and relevant information was that was being returned.

                            Chat with Bing allows you to get the complete answers you are looking for. Chat with Bing allows you to ask complex questions and get better answers by providing more details, 
                            clarity and ideas with results that include citations and links that allow you to act on any responses or get creative inspiration with the benefits of Generative AI combined 
                            with the power of search. Chat with Bing supports three conversation styles which can be more Creative where responses are original and imaginative, creating surprise and 
                            entertainment or more Balanced where responses are reasonable and coherent, balancing accuracy and creativity in conversation and more Precise where responses are factual 
                            and concise, prioritising accuracy and relevancy.
                        </p>

                            <strong>When will the world end?</strong> - There are many theories about when and how the world will end. Some scientists believe that the most likely scenario for the total annihilation of Earth is being engulfed 
                            into the Sun as it transforms into a 'red giant' star. This is estimated to happen in about 7.59 billion years1. However, there are also many other theories and predictions 
                            about the end of the world, some of which are based on religious or mystical beliefs rather than scientific evidence. Ultimately, no one can say for certain when or how the 
                            world will end.
