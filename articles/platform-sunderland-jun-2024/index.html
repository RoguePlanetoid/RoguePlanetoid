                        <p>
                            When getting investment think about what you need to get to where you need to get to and what will the investment be used for and can your business support that debt going 
                            forward and would equity investment be suitable where can get investment in return for shares. Investors will need to see a business plan or pitch deck, what management and 
                            staff you have and strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats along with contingency for worst case scenarios plus consider environmental, social and governance but 
                            there is a lot of support available, but think about reducing carbon footprint and how much water is being used etc. Also, for compliance do you have management team, 
                            shareholders etc.

                        <h4>MMC Research - Natasha McDonough</h4>
                        <p>
                            <a href="https://mmc.agency" target="_blank">MMC</a> is based in Sunderland and Natasha has been here for a few years, the business was founded in 2015 they had a long career 
                            in strategic marketing and had a successful career but were made redundant and went to job centre and got an enterprise loan and had an idea for their business and their 
                            business turns ten next year. They always wanted a team and have grown really fast and did strategic marketing and looking into doing market research but when COVID hit 
                            most of their business disappeared overnight, but they were able to keep the market research as they had an advocate and supporter of their business and in the last few 
                            months they have had more enquiries than the previous few years.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            They have clients of all shapes and sizes including doing anti-social behaviour research for the Durham Police, a private equity software company in the Netherlands, 
                            or most people's research in Sunderland - they are paid to be nosy. They do a lot for the community and often do it because they want to.

                        <p>
                            Answers to the questions you dare not to ask for a voice of customer to find out what your clients think of you, may want to know if people are going to use your products 
                            more or less in the next year, experience of customer service or feedback about features in the products. Client may want to know if they want certain products and 
                            functionalities but also suggest add knowing about customer service and other elements of their business and provide back a SWOT analysis to the company. They still 
                            have that zest for the business and super excited for the opportunities and have supported many people including tenants who might not tell people directly but were 
                            able to speak to MMC and helped them introduce an event which wouldn't have been possible without that support.

                            A survey will tell you what people think but there is intelligence and science behind working out a survey, but when you do the deep dive and qualitive and focus groups 
                            this will tell you why people think the way they do about something. Can do surveys and then do a follow-up focus group and interviews to get real thoughts and opinions 
                            from potential or existing customers.

                        <p>
                            Phil is from Sunderland and <a href="https://www.tigerenergyconsultants.com/" target="_blank">Tiger Energy Consultants</a> was set up last year, it is growing slowly and steadily. They work with individual on a consultancy basis, and they are a 
                            bespoke team of business energy and utility experts. They are offering a low-cost agile approach including a market monitor service by allowing their customers not to be caught 
                            out by movements in the market.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They help SMEs with their utility procurement as the wrong contract can cost companies a lot of money, they understand their customers business requirements and priorities and 
                            they always present customers with the full cost of all their options for gas and electricity and do quarterly updates, they also do water provider audits although this is a 
                            new sector.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Their approach is to develop long term growth through delivery of value and service to customers there are also new requirements for brokers the past couple of years. Their 
                            model is predicated on residual only revenue and renewal incentives for sales staff. They have key supply partners such as SSE, Utilita and Tomato which has amazing software 
                            that operates behind the scenes. They are supplier neutral and supply all options and many people just do one supplier as they probably have a commercial agreement with those 
                            suppliers, but they are agnostic to supplier.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They have routes to market such as their existing network, also have formal and informal relationships for affiliates and share the commission generated from any sales, 
                            they will also do direct marketing. They get paid by getting the wholesale price and then the cost of sale is substantially undercut compared to many competitors and do a 
                            best price guarantee, energy suppliers often will also have a commission that is paid. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Water sector for new supply contracts is tiny and meters aren't accurate so they do a review and if they find any issues they will do that on a no-win-no-fee basis. They have 
                            a dual compliance regime and have recently worked with an ethical supermarket and were able to save them over £20,000 in a year. They are also up for the North East FIRST 
                            Startup awards in June.

                        <p>
                            <a href="https://twentyeight28propertygroup.co.uk/" target="_blank">TwentyEight28 Property Group</a> are an ethical property investment group and want to make sure high 
                            quality and affordable homes are brought into use. They want to enhance housing numbers and improve quality standards creating inclusion, diversity and thriving communities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The business is relatively new, but Josh had experience in the construction industry but was made redundant due to global downturn and then moved into a big blue-chip company 
                            heading up supply management and then went on to a few other things. They are a member of the Chartered Institute of Credit Management and one of the few in the area who are.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They believe everyone deserves a safe and secure place to call home, they were born in Sunderland in a typical council estate but went through a lot of trauma and things that 
                            shouldn't have been happening. There are many people homeless in Sunderland including people from the military who find themselves in that position.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They are a business with a mission to expand access to quality homes for vulnerable families and individuals across our region. They started in 2024 and they have invested in a 
                            lot of knowledge and been speaking with Sunderland Council and housing associations, it is a promise for people to have a home where they can flourish and somewhere they can eat 
                            and sleep the following day. They aren't driven by monetary values, but they need to have returns to be able to provide sustained living conditions and they want to see vibrant 
                            ecosystems. North East is mostly white British and need to change the mindset when you bring in diversity that helps the community grow and brings economic development.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They are regulated, certified and fully accredited in property management. The challenge is there is high demand and low supply and tend to be of low quality, there are 
                            resource constraints and cost pressures. They work with clients and investors to identify the right properties in the right area and they enhance the conditions and quality 
                            of the properties to their own quality standards and testing which is basically would they put their own family in that house if not they won't put anyone there. They make 
                            properties available to vulnerable families and individuals to call their home through their social supportiveships.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They use their expert area and industry knowledge, where is there a need for diversity and where there is good rental demand to meet investor's needs, they need to see if it 
                            delivers to any needs. They provide a service to investors including a property portfolio service allows those who don't have the time to build a portfolio they can do this by 
                            investing £50,000 and possess a rental property to start with and 90% is totally passive, they also worked with angel investors who want to put their money to good use and get 
                            better returns from what banks provide with Fixed Investment Loans.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They improve property standards, sustainable and affordable rents by reducing these to around 80% of market rate, they increase property supply and expand capacity where 9% 
                            of homes are empty or derelict properties in Sunderland which they can bring back into use. They help create economic growth and community inclusion and diversity and 
                            uplifting everyone. They are looking for people to make ethical investments with bank-beating returns or for those looking to sell their property.

                        <h4>Oculus HR - Louise Kennedy</h4>
                        <p>
                            Louise is the managing director of <a href="https://oculus-hr.co.uk/" target="_blank">Oculus HR</a>, they have worked in various roles over the years. They started their business in 2013 as they were completing their role but 
                            were thinking about what to do next and looked into HR consultancy and thinking about going into businesses and giving advice and support. The reason it is call Oculus HR 
                            due to going the Pantheon in Rome which has an Oculus and things of the light that can be brought into a business and the added value they can provide. They worked with BIC 
                            to help get those first initial steps on what to do next, how to get your first client or what to do first and a lot of different things but the support was invaluable to 
                            be able to shape their initial stages.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They really wanted to do something but didn't know what it was, they wanted more flexibility and had a desire to do something and since they were good at HR they thought they 
                            could do a fantastic job and the next things that come along afterwards. They got support in those early days was stepping out from their job, they needed support with going 
                            out and networking, they didn't know what they didn't know. They needed to make it work so thought about what they were prepared to do to make it work, they also did things 
                            on an interim part-time basis, they went from there to Great Run company and gave them the money on the bank to take things forward. They did get some funding around getting 
                            help with the website but there are more resources and help available.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In their family they didn't know any business owners, but they have found people you can share situations with friends that can offer help, it is different from day-to-day 
                            chats with friends as can pick up the phone and talk about things and tell them about being shortlisted for awards and celebrating success with people is important.
                            The North East is a very friendly place with a close knit community with so many people out there to champion other people and can get help from other people and can build 
                            connections and refer people to other people. Your network is important, if you don't have one find someone who has or attend events such as PLATFORM. Going out networking 
                            is important but can't be everywhere so can decide what is right or wrong for you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thinking about things like what do you charge for something like writing a letter. It was just Louise when starting out and they got work from their network and referrals 
                            but one of their first networking events resulted in work a few years later as remembered who they were and a lot of their work comes from referrals and are very consistent 
                            with how they use their platforms such as LinkedIn and marketing, this has been built from networking and getting that opportunity. Word of mouth is important, you never 
                            know where work will come from or what to expect, when talking to someone you don't know who they may know who may come to you. You build up that reputation as often people 
                            want to have things resolved quickly, they recently did some emotional intelligence training which resulted in doing some work for them in return. Reputation is what people 
                            are saying about you when you are not there.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Oculus HR does HR consultancy including day-to-day transactional HR, they do things for companies just starting up with their first employee with starter packs, or larger 
                            companies with hundreds of employees. They are able to support small businesses to put in a structure for managing their people, they do HR mentoring and coaching along 
                            with a whole host of things. They do master classes and training at management level to bring some consistency in and also do a Real World HR podcast including industry 
                            insights and real-life discussions and there's so much really great information and all sorts of people from all levels and for those who love podcasts there's plenty to 
                            listen to.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Challenges along the way, was told it was a lifestyle business before but is now a business going though fast growth and have 47% growth compared to the previous year and 
                            they are growing at pace and need to ensure that business structure grows at growth. You just have to have the right mindset, may have moments of what are you going to do 
                            here but can approach those challenges such as making sure people they bring in know what they are doing and know who the person is who would be a good fit in the business. 
                            Need to be prepared to take that risk to take the next steps, they have bootstrapped the business but did right things at the right times but will look at what it takes to 
                            grow the business but they love what they do and love to be able to deliver and be able to reach the right balance, every time you level up you learn more skills.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They have done programmes that have helped them, they also got a coach last year, but they didn't know what they needed so found someone who was good for that, they also found 
                            someone who does spiritual counselling and did a business coach but found they needed to have one on one rather than  one of many support. You just want to find someone to 
                            offload onto and speak to, Louise has also focused on their own health and wellbeing, you need to be the best version of you enables the business to grow and enables a better 
                            lifestyle, just to be able to spend time with someone every couple of weeks helps and they are in a good headspace that helps the flow, need to take that moment to look after 
                            yourself including knowing how to decompress.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Future plans are to grow over the next few years, is a case of why we can't as they have the ability to do it and have right team in place and can put the right plans in 
                            place to make that growth happen. They love Sunderland and what they are doing in the whole area, the difference made on the seafront in Seaburn, engagement and new buildings 
                            in the city and the landscape in the next few years will be very different, people should be more involved in Sunderland and take another look. Think collectively of the 
                            North East and Sunderland is not far from Newcastle but senior business people don't seem to know what is going on in Sunderland and need to understand better what is going 
                            on there.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Pivot point to a more established business, but they did take those early stages seriously and treated as a business where they needed to cover their costs, they didn't like 
                            it being described as a lifestyle business but there are certain points such as three years ago where they wanted more and they had the freedom to be able to grow the business 
                            and brought in their husband to do more in the business at that point, the financial dependency is the driver of the business.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Going from one person to a team was just adding someone informally who did a bit of work here and there for them but now work full time for the business, can also work with 
                            people on a freelance basis including being able to manage your own costs and expenses. They recruited people working a few days a week then now full time. There is enough 
                            work for them to do but can start part-time and then take them on full time so they continuously look at people and will look for people who can make three times their salary.
                        </p>
