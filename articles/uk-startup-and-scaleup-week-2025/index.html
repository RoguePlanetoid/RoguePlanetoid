                    <h4>Intro & Welcome - Paul Lancaster</h4>
                    <p>
                        Paul Lancaster opened UK Startup and Scaleup week with Day One held at The Fire Station which is a
                        vibrant and mid-scale performance venue in Sunderland. Paul mentioned that everyone there speaking
                        has inspire Paul and he has curated everything including the music and the day is about inspiring
                        and motivating anyone starting or growing a business.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Paul thanked those who are helping to support the event including Xero, Sunderland City Council,

                        Paul Callaghan was interviewed so many times by Joey but this place is so personal for him and is
                        great to have everyone there, the vision back was back in 2012 when he thought the city was pretty
                        low ebb and had been speaking to the president of the student's union and asked them what they
                        thought of Sunderland which was the university was okay but there's not much else to do so from
                        there started the idea of the culture quarter. The fire station was built and opened in 1908 and
                        closed in 1992 and stood empty for twenty five years but wanted an auditorium and where it is was a
                        bomb site from World War II and the biggest raid of the war, his grandfather saw the explosion from
                        here who thought the Empire theatre and Fire Station were gone but they survived but this place was
                        a warehouse that was bombed.

                        David Martin had just been to Kuwait and is off to Seoul in a few days but is involved in e-sports
                        which is an elite sport. E-sports, video games 3.5 billion people play them, and half a billion
                        people participate in them or watch them. The problem brands have is engaging this young audience,
                        but e-sports and gaming is the way to reach out to them and will be bringing up a fund to
                        Sunderland. They give their time to make Sunderland the UK and global capital of e-sports where they
                        have a suite of houses where people are educated and businesses will start and grow, and these
                        people are elite athletes to train to play, and they start at 13 and there will be an Olympic Games
                        for e-sports in two years. Also think about health wellness and nutrition and they want to bring in
                        visitors and businesses from all over the world and make their home here. Sunderland is an
                        incredible city with passionate people to bring in new jobs, businesses and tourism. They are trying
                        to build an e-sports arena which will be a multi-purpose venue and will be starting work on this in
                        the summer and are almost ready to go and are putting a lot on the line. It will be the only one in
                        the UK and globally that can pull together business, entertainment and tournament side to
                        performance and wellbeing. What they are building which includes studios as well as the e-sports
                        facilities and are building this for the kids and make sure we are ready and get them involved and
                        the future will be okay.

                        Rita Collins is regional director at NatWest and are involved in the event. Rita is super passionate
                        about the North since they have been here since 2012, these events are important as it is those
                        people who found and start an idea, or they see something being done and realise they can do
                        something in a different way - all these organisations started somewhere and they want to be here to
                        see what support they can provide although may not be the right funders they can be that connector
                        and provide other support to start your business and help with challenges. What Rita has seen and
                        encouraged them is, they started their career twenty years ago in London and moved up here and
                        thought their career was over as was complete naivete but saw how things were and how they are now
                        with the mayor Kim McGuiness and have seen companies come up from London and come to the North East.
                        They are super passionate about the people here and businesses.

                        David Pattison from Sunderland City Council said there hasn't been a more exciting time for the
                        area, just walking into the city today and seeing how things are progressing has been fantastic. The
                        scale of what is going on is about thirty / forty years of investment happening in ten years and
                        lots of things are thriving and there is more opportunity in Sunderland than ever before and are
                        creating accommodation to bring businesses in the city and support businesses in Sunderland to have
                        a home. This not only involves indigenous businesses but others coming into the city, and it is the
                        most exciting time in the city in their lifetime. Have got the best package for supporting
                        businesses in Sunderland there is UK shared prosperity funding and have created a package for
                        businesses of all shapes and sizes and would encourage people to speak to them with something for
                        everyone, funding is time limited and is extended for this financial year but from March next year
                        don't really know what is going to happen going forward. Having a mayor and different frame of
                        leadership has helped with business support through the combined authority so are working closely
                        and need to ensure what is put in place is fit for purpose and works so businesses get what they
                        need to grow and thrive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sharon is always championing businesses and the key thing they see is the collaboration between
                        businesses on a number of different things and when starting and scaling up there's a level of
                        support that is definitely not available everywhere. There has been a change of leadership in the
                        last ten years as the city centre didn't have much investment for thirty years, but changes have
                        made a difference, and people are able to come in and do something fantastic. Landlords are prepared
                        to take a risk and there's a lot of help where Mackie's Corner has now been filled with businesses
                        and 150 units have been created for businesses, agents are more engaged than before in what the
                        future looks and are part of the conversation and are looking at what part people are going to play,
                        people were doing their own thing but now are working together. Have to set things up for the future
                        not just for now and need to make it relevant today and in the future and for those coming and what
                        their expectations will be. What would help people is being in-touch and helping and supporting each
                        other and take advantage of events, go to the relevant things and talk to the right people, so
                        actually engage if you are starting up or scaling up here.

                        Paul McEldon provides support for networking with the North East BIC and they have never felt such a
                        buzz at the moment than ever before. They witnessed the passion and pride in London when Sunderland
                        played there in Trafalgar Square, if you have the pride, passion, people and plan then that is great
                        to see. They see the plan, vision and ambition is tangible and the people looking for startup advice
                        are talking about Music City and Crown Works even if they aren't involved. They have had production
                        companies who want to be at Crown Works, they have had someone relocate near there who does Clapper
                        Boards for productions all over the world. They heard someone who had come back to Sunderland who
                        wanted to teach people to sing and were able to connect them with Music City and someone who won UK
                        agents of the year and wouldn't have been able to do this there three years ago. Sunderland is going
                        somewhere, and Sunderland is top of the league for businesses since Covid and North East BIC has set
                        up over a hundred businesses in the city and there is a lot going on in Sunderland.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Paul Callaghan talked about the idea of Music City which dates back to 2015 which help set off
                        bidding for UK City of Culture and were laughed at but they put together a great team and showed
                        what they were going to do and got to the last two and it was like switching a switch and people
                        were more confident and were against Coventry and were doing the final pitch but the decision was
                        made but they lost but had a huge party but decided to do something about it. They realised there is
                        a huge music scene so decided to put together a bid to become a world music city before covid but
                        afterwards put together a bid and a team and pitched to the world music cities network in Berlin and
                        they decided they would announce a strategy this year even when they didn't know they got it, and
                        when they did they kept it quiet and brought the managing director from Berlin and would be able to
                        announce they joined Sydney, Berlin, Edinburgh and Manchester to join organisations about music
                        being an exciting part of the city and will be having a year of music in Sunderland between world
                        music day this year and next year. There will be a whole series of things happening including grass
                        roots and people wanting to start their career and all of the business that goes behind it to make
                        Sunderland a real creative city, to make Sunderland a place where talent wants to live. Have gone
                        through three stages people use to look backwards to being the best shipbuilding town in the world,
                        then changed things to turn hope into belief and when that happens you get ambition, and this place
                        today is packed with people full of ambition.
                    <p>
                        One piece of inspiration or seed of hope that was a turning point is from David Pattison is to get
                        in touch, knows it is tough but there is a package of support and want as many businesses to tap
                        into this as possible and want this support to go to the business community, they don't want to
                        underspend. Paul Callaghan talked about opening up the North East BIC and thirty years later have a
                        really successful business but they had knockbacks but if you believe in yourself and business you
                        will succeed. Rita talked about whatever you do you'll have some kind of challenge but the reality
                        is businesses in the region are resilient and there is a whole community of support and networking,
                        why do we fall over so we can pick ourselves up again - there is a lot of talent and perseverance,
                        but NatWest are here to support the community. Paul McEldon is support with events like Growth Lab
                        where people have shared their invaluable experiences and there's a whole lot of support in
                        Sunderland and across the whole North East and venues have needed to change due to needing more
                        people to fit in.

                        Serios works with Sunderland football club for over three years, they typically work with big
                        corporate enterprises, but football clubs are much like these. Serios is based out of Newcastle but
                        have a good relationship with Sunderland AFC which is now a premier league club. David has worked in
                        MLS in the United States where they were the chief marketing officer and left to come to Sunderland.
                        It has been a great period and opportunity for the city and what happened last week at Wembley with
                        the opportunity of the glare of the world where everyone will benefit. They have worked most of
                        their career in the United States, but here they wanted to be like Ted Lasso, the American way is
                        driven by service and lots of businesses live and die on great service, and they have brought to
                        Sunderland that things aren't just red and white but are grey.

                        Sunderland has changed a lot, and things are looking more positive. Their vision for coming back to
                        Sunderland and one of the things that struck them was the idea of being fancentric and putting the
                        fan at the centre of everything, you can open the doors and just let people in so need to orient a
                        football club to put the fans at the centre. You can't get anywhere without brilliant people, need
                        to have vision and direction of travel, their core is working with big brands to distil an idea at
                        the core of a business and let them live or die on this idea. How do you distil the purpose of who
                        you are and for Sunderland AFC is being about the fans, the story or being a fan and following the
                        club is at the heart of the city of Sunderland and have a fanbase who are utterly obsessed and most
                        of the time supporting them has made them miserable. How do you figure out the vision so need to
                        serve those who are relentlessly obsessed with the club and to make sure that everyone understands
                        what they are doing to serve this purpose, you need to work really hard to super serve the fans and
                        understand what makes it special.

                        Innovating through data and insight with the partnership between Serios group and Sunderland AFC to
                        drive the club's ambitions forward. You can provide people with the right data to help them go
                        forwards. Serios worked with the club and was easy to buy into this and have a platform to bring
                        together the data points for football including Opta but there's also a whole range of different
                        sources of data to help them day in and day out along with CRM and operational systems and for the
                        obsession of the fanbase and what the fans want needed data to help decisions for the desires of
                        what the fans wanted. Sunderland AFC could be more data driven to be a data driven football club.
                        Sunderland AFC had figured out the driving principals, but they didn't just want to talk about it
                        but be grounded in real tangible action, work with local firms as much as possible. Data is a very
                        intimate thing so you need someone you can trust around, and it is the special sauce of your
                        business. They wanted to unlock the data opportunity and clearly have a large fanbase locally and
                        internationally as a club which is over 140 years old and have won as many league titles as Chelsea
                        albeit most before the Second World War. You need to figure out and understand why people follow
                        Sunderland and what do they do when they have their attraction and with the platform, they have been
                        able to start to unlock this and understand data and customers.

                        Unifying football and commercial data into one platform with football data, website, social media,
                        CRM, payments, stadium metrics, academy performance analytics, reviews, retail and ticketing. Their
                        fans will consume lots of things and tell people about these things to build deeply engaged people
                        and as a football club have to track all these inputs so people who buy tickets for matches and
                        other events need to understand them, for retail who is buying and where are they buying from with
                        people buying from all over the world and when they win or lose how does that affect what they sell.
                        They can look at what happens when a game happens, what changes what they do, when are they coming
                        to the stadium and get them to come sooner and spend more by making the offering around the stadium
                        more appealing and get people more excited about the football club. Can see a customer in the
                        platform, see what they bought and what they've done and where they live.

                        Before their partnership they had disparate sources of data but how do you pull that together to
                        create a common view of the customer but what this can unlock is unbelievable power. Serios One is a
                        platform where Sunderland AFC is a demanding customer such as how many shirts were sold around going
                        to Wembley so need that information immediately and cannot afford to miss out. Serios One is a
                        framework that is compatible with other services to automate data engineering to get value from data
                        and get answers that are posed on a daily basis. They help the club bring together a number of
                        disconnected systems very quickly and had CRM, retail and ticketing brought together within eight
                        weeks of engagement. This enabled Sunderland AFC to use data in the right way to look in the future,
                        leading indicators of success are what people are feeling and what they may do in the future, have
                        many things pulled together the connect them in the platform to then look at what they can do with
                        that data in the future, squeezing out the lagging stuff isn't as important as looking ahead.
                        Building on the momentum of what's next as being in the premier league and how the partnership will
                        evolve with this new challenge and use insights from bringing all the data together. There's no time
                        to mess about but with the foundation that is in place they can take advantage of the opportunity
                        and there are opportunities to be a commercial partner of the club.

                    <p>                        
                        What is the best version of you look like? Adds is a videographer and content creator. When growing
                        up it was about being normal and do the 9 - 5 job and follow progression of School, University and
                        Job. The feeling of doing the norm didn't feel right for them but after school they wanted to switch
                        things up a bit so decided to buy a camera to have a go at and create some content and was before
                        content was really a thing. They started filming people including rappers, songwriters etc but the
                        dream was just a dream, but doors were starting to open, and they named the channel after themselves
                        and build an unbelievable network of people including many before, they became famous. They have
                        pretty much filmed in every city in the UK and their views were growing and doors were opening but
                        when they went back home to edit their videos, but they had no money and didn't know what to do, so
                        wondered why they had nothing if they were giving everything.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They've snuck into lifts to have conversation with people and were brave to do things like getting
                        into events with a press pass to film things and always tried but always failed but when doing
                        filming they wanted to make money. They started a business for clothing but failed and did other
                        things like partner with the MoBo awards and got recognised but it was just a partnership but didn't
                        make any money. They also tried to get into the One Show to do some editing and did some shadow
                        editing, but they couldn't afford to live in London. They got the job which was what everyone told
                        them to do but that person they always was, and still am it felt wrong, empty and purposeless but
                        remember doing a job in a national corporation in construction and it was everything their family
                        and friends said was great, but it wasn't. On their commute they would listen to motivational
                        speakers like Paul Mort but was looking for any kind of motivation to get out the mindset they were
                        feeling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They quit their job and one day their girlfriend at the time, now fiancée and they felt upset even
                        though had a job and property and inside they had dreams wanting to do something with the camera and
                        saw people who seemed no better than them so encouraged them to quit and get out of that mindset.
                        They tried to sell their service, they visited businesses all over the country and asked to do some
                        content but felt they would rather be skint for the rest of their life. Someone took a chance on
                        them who they created some content for free, but they believed in their skill and on the way to
                        somewhere asked for his bank details and got paid £300 but they were able to get a testimonial and
                        is still a client today but was the first person they helped. It is often the word of someone that
                        is important which was originally to do content for free and led them to pay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There's always obstacles, they were driving down to an event and had been asked to film it and were
                        asked to bring their gimble down, which they bought and, on the way, down they hadn't checked their
                        equipment, pulled into Greggs to then check their gear and check the gimble but it was broken. They
                        drove again but were running late but they went in to see what they can do and on the table was a
                        gimble which worked fine and from this they met influencers and others who helped. They could have
                        just given up, but they used this to buy better and more equipment and went to a gym and asked
                        people if they wanted content and things started to look better. Rejection did happen but they went
                        for it more, they got a car, hoody and t-shirt with Content PT and would speak to people, you
                        shouldn't fake it till you make it, but they call it blagifestation.

                    <p>
                        When you have an idea, just make the video or no matter what it is, they had an idea to fly out to
                        Dubai where everyone in fitness went during Covid and took photos and be able to introduce
                        themselves to people and got content from those there and when they returned people mentioned seeing
                        their content and was the foundation of where they started and got to now. Be careful who you look
                        up to as it might just change your life so might make a connection which may change over time and
                        Paul Mort is a client of his and is sharing the stage with him. They went to an event called
                        Bodypower and took photos of everyone at the event and catch people before they do well but there
                        was someone, they didn't take a photo of as they wanted them as a client and now work with them and
                        thanks to that working with the biggest brands in business.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each time they took photos they thought to themselves to keep going, put the graft in as it could be
                        the best life ever, whatever it may be it will require a lot of work, working all hours and not
                        knowing where the money will come from but remember put that work in. They thought why not do a
                        podcast and put that work in to have these conversations and committed to do 100 episodes and have
                        never missed a beat and expect to get 100,000 views, watch the journey and follow the episodes and
                        think to yourself that's the guy you saw in Sunderland. If you're thinking about changing jobs, why
                        not you - “most people see things as they are and ask why? I dream things that never were and ask
                        why not” always challenge stuff, it doesn't matter if it hasn't been done before, do something that
                        you haven't done before, make a post, post it now, do something different and take that step.
                        Alfie talked to Adds and if you imagine a graph of your life and their life has been like that, they
                        did book a flight to Dubai they didn't arrange anything they just knew they needed to be where
                        people are and are better in person than they are online and feel people don't get the real deal
                        online. Things are exciting and bubbling right now and they want to do their own show and started
                        podcast as found it hard to sit down and speak to someone and felt this is quite challenging and
                        want to be number one and beat the Bartletts of the world.

                        Donna is a PhD doctor and best friends with Cheryl and started their business seven years ago and to
                        give tools to take outside of the room. How it all started was they met at work after working on
                        corporate for twenty years and their loved their jobs but felt there was more to do and felt they
                        would come together and do something in the world and make a difference. They thought they both
                        wanted to be coaches and didn't want to look back with regret so decided not to do that, down tools
                        and start a business.

                    <p>
                        They had always had a pipe dream of starting a business and speaking about the things people are
                        thinking about instead of what people were wanting to hear, They researched people and they thought
                        about what it would be like but the first year of their business was tough, they didn't know anyone
                        in this world and were starting from scratch, they learned a lot and they knew there was no going
                        back. In May 2019 they were a year into the business, and it was the Newcastle Startup Week and
                        heard Steven Bartlett and was inspired by this.

                        Think about inspiring people to speak at this event and then you can make a promise to yourself to
                        do. They made a decision to move into bigger and better things and one of the things was to write a
                        book and this is a big part of their legacy, they kept going and by 2022 they were filling rooms
                        with people to change their lives and starting running retreats in stunning locations and they dared
                        to dream and become a TEDx speaker and achieved their goal with the first TEDx women's event outside
                        of London in Middlesbrough. They've also launched their own certification which combines many
                        different aspects together. It is their mission to get people to find their purpose and they have
                        worked with many brands and featured in many publications. They turned over £1,000,000 in the first
                        four years. They had a dream and decided to take one step after another and another and if they can
                        do it anyone can.

                        Three success strategies to go and do, the first being be more unicorn - for them do you get how
                        unique you are and there has never been anyone like you and never will be anyone like you, comparing
                        yourself with others and imposter syndrome is common but they want you to embrace that difference,
                        what you do and what you know and the experiences you know. The more you are true to you the more
                        you will earn - what is the thing you would do if your unicorn was in charge. Second strategy is be
                        delusional - forget logic and numbers, even when friends and family saying otherwise you have to
                        silence it out and affirm or believe to see it to manifest and get so sure in your mind what you
                        want to create and decide what you want to have knowing your purpose and passion, so be delusional
                        to be 100% committed to becoming that version of you. Third strategy is money mindset mastery, in
                        corporate they were earning loads but missed out on so much due to the sacrifices to get the money
                        they needed, the things you believe to be true about money are what you grew up with, your money
                        stories were all predetermined before you started so need to work on that mindset, people find it
                        hard to ask for money in exchange for something, need to identify the money story you currently have
                        then imprint the one that will get you to your goals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can be, do or have anything you want...don't let anyone else's limitations become yours, you are
                        the creator of your reality.

                    <p>
                        Paul wanted to coach men and help them with what they need to do. They have seen some interesting
                        comments from people, some of them hurt and sting a little bit and wouldn't be the comments they
                        would hear from people. They are a big fan of practicality and don't like theory, when you start
                        doing something then when you're winning losers will let you know and if you haven't experienced any
                        negativity then you will. They then started doing something else which is how you can use this, so
                        share what these people are saying about them, they even replied to these comments the most common
                        on is “just man up”. Most people say just block and delete them but then they wouldn't get as many
                        posts and comments.
                    </p>                            
                    <p>
                        People ask when's the next welcome to the show, their average views per video is around 3 - 4
                        thousand but made a video online trolls in real life where they had people come up and say the
                        comments in real life and got over 60,000 views which is where they let other people create their
                        content for them based on the horrible comments and another video had over 100,000 views. When you
                        are truly at peace and in touch with yourself and nothing anyone says or does bothers you and no
                        negativity or drams can touch you. People are thinking they are trying their best but can probably
                        do more, they wanted to get better at Jujitsu do personal one-to-one sessions and watch videos to
                        get better but this did result in a injury which meant they couldn't do it anymore and they would
                        get out of shape and their thoughts went from flying with jujitsu to living with their mam.
                        They were catastrophising, but when doing something you can't just dabbling in it but start doubling
                        down on the thing you want to get good at as that is what the pros do, they don't do anything else.
                        He knows someone with one of the biggest podcasts but see people who want to start and get
                        disappointed when not as big as him, but he doesn't do anything else - he just does podcasts. They
                        had built up there was only negatives, but you can only love things you can see both sides off so
                        started to see the positives and see what other things they could do. Why is something comfortable
                        is because you've done it loads - that is usually the only difference, people expect to be confident
                        by stuff they've never done, why would you believe you can do something you have never done, you
                        need to do it anyway, if it is hard and uncomfortable you should do it anyway. Paul gives up some of
                        his time to go into jails and help the inmates out a bit and it was everything they thought it would
                        be the things you see on films in a tour including isolation and they go to do a talk and there is a
                        group of people staring at them while with the warden, it was a very intimidating environment and
                        felt things they hadn't felt before but felt gratitude in a positive way and fulfilled from speaking
                        to those there, but before that felt fear, nerves and anxiety but it is difficult to not feel like
                        they did afterwards without going through the difficult feelings which is the same when growing your
                        business.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The cost of entry to success is failure, so if feel nervous or intimated and don't believe imposter
                        syndrome is a thing but what it is, is discomfort which means growth, you have to go through this.
                        The river of change is current life and body are an artifact of your past based on old thoughts,
                        actions and habits but if want new results need have new thoughts, beliefs, actions and habits and
                        to get there you have to step into the river of change, can't do the same things and expect a
                        different result. The reason for not getting into the river of change, those who moan and don't do
                        anything about it as it is known, familiar, predictable and certain. Business is uncertain as you're
                        not guaranteed anything as it takes courage to get going. You have to do things you aren't familiar
                        with and have to be okay with uncertainty and need to overcome self-doubt, fear, nerves, worry,
                        no-confidence, insecurity and overwhelm. When they feel nervous that means they are feeling high
                        energy, these feelings are feedback and then when you do the things that you want you feel
                        confident, calm, self-believe, self-worth and self-esteem and these come afterwards and in the river
                        of change people will criticise, judge and more. If it is not you then who and if it is not now when
                        is it?

                        Developing innovative tech products & bringing them to market. What Dave is motivated by and
                        interested in. Tharsus help make businesses progress by designing and building strategic machines
                        that transform performance and create new opportunity, They work up in Blyth where they basically
                        build and design machinery for other people from dustbins to robots that look inside jet engines.
                        Their passion is physical products that people interact with that enables ideas to fruition. Inside
                        the building are machines doing different things to deliver market potential and until machines
                        build themselves they will do it to deliver the outcomes of the inventors, people with ideas or
                        those to transform their business they are fortunate to be involved in and help people understand
                        what the outcome they are trying to get and once they get there they have the energy to get there.
                        Their company is about physically doing things, they think about how many Xmas dinners are happening
                        because of the things they do, what services will it deliver and what things will it deliver by
                        doing things including helping people outside the country and creating solutions in the North East
                        and just get things done and get it made. Time is always flying by so people need to get things to
                        market as soon as possible. When are trying to do something what is that outcome you are trying to
                        deliver, and they work in a supply chain throughout the globe which is brought into Blyth and put
                        together and shipped out in the rest of the world. They started out as a business in Hebburn doing
                        sheet metal work in the 1960s but are a startup in themselves about focusing on an idea and how it
                        can be taken to a market on how it can be brought to fruition.

                    <p>
                        Fire bullets, then cannonballs - this about focus and if you're confident if it is the right time to
                        focus so do you fire that one cannonball or fire out the bullets and listen to feedback for the
                        first positive consequence and then go all in, you have to ensure you have some degree of
                        entitlement so you get there when you get there. Ready to ship, re-think your “must-haves” so
                        identify your critical product features clearly, imagine launch day - what is truly essential now
                        and now revisit your critical produce features to ship boldly and iterate rapidly. Understand what
                        your customers will do once they have your products and services as it will be beyond what you can
                        imagine. You have to get out there in the market with as few features as you need to when getting
                        out in the market with the features that deliver the most value, you can learn about the things the
                        market will do to you, you can refine, refine and refine plus true market value comes from paying
                        customers, proof first and iteration next. If they had got people to pay for something earlier, then
                        they would have learned so much more than when they were providing it for free. If you are
                        developing something, make sure you can get something ready and work out what your customers can get
                        so you can get some feedback from there. The power of collaboration is know your strengths, find the
                        right people for the right jobs and actively build and nurture your network plus people are willing
                        to share and can even help avoid making the same mistakes but you can still make your own but be
                        confident in yourself and leverage things that other people are confident in that you are not.

                    <p>
                        Daniel has founded Dent and also has software such as Score App and has written a set of books on
                        entrepreneurship. There have been big shifts and change in the early 2020s which includes ChatGPT
                        and AI which we felt it was going to change the world as it was a shocking experience to see how far
                        it has come and think about these shifts and how it will impact business.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are wholesale changes in the economy such as from agricultural to the industrial age where
                        revolutions in steam, producing metals, oil and electricity which took over the world and changed
                        the economy. Before this you had to own land, then factories and offices but it wasn't possible to
                        go from factory worker to factory owner. Digital came and this was a different way of doing things
                        and it does a few remarkable things as when have an idea it can be available quickly and all over
                        the world as it is a different way of producing value so came up with idea of entrepreneur as people
                        don't have to work for someone else they can start their own thing or collaborate with others but at
                        the centre of what you do is intellectual property. You will have people leveraging technology and
                        those who aren't getting ahead of other people, this also puts you in competition with everyone in
                        the world. The opportunity is to build a global business focused on a niche that isn't linked to a
                        location.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Big shift is from geography to ideal customer persona which is a particular kind of customer you are
                        targeting, and you can't get too specific about this you need to know as much as possible about
                        their frustrations and desires as biggest customers now are in the cloud and don't think about
                        geography. When you can deliver any product or service from any part of the world then if you are
                        limited and they are not they will come after you. You need to open your business up and focus on a
                        clear ideal customer persona and the types of issues you can solve.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Audience spending power means you need to think of ideal customer persona as targeting too many
                        people will drive your prices down, so you need to choose one that is in the bracket you want.
                        Luxury market needs big accolades but below this are the affluent niche who are interested in
                        following thought leaders and those who can explain their situation and if you can show you are a
                        key person of influence in their particular niche which is one of the best places to go for which is
                        a high value outcome with niche positioning to attract the best clients.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another big shift is from skills to scalable intellectual property, you were told the best way is to
                        go from unskilled labour to skilled labour to get more skills to get higher incomes but this is not
                        true now as those people don't have huge success as digital introduced a new category where you want
                        to go to the intellectual property level such as problems you know how to solve in your unique way,
                        wins and victories you had. Incorporate into your routine to stop, reflect and document where you go
                        somewhere quiet and ask a question when was the last time I did something special for a certain type
                        of person or customer where I got a remarkable result that I could explain it step by step. You need
                        to document this and write it down, don't just go to the next bit. If you didn't get or capture
                        positive feedback that you need to capture and document this and this is a little piece of
                        intellectual property you can then preserve, this is the thing that makes the most value. Once you
                        have intellectual property think about turning it into media and how you swap it into data which
                        could be tips, tricks or lists. When people enjoy your media, they are comfortable sharing their
                        data including email address or filling out survey. You can now prompt software with AI to perform
                        so anyone can start producing technology alongside their business, so you can move yourself up the
                        hierarchy of value. Bookmagic.ai is an AI platform for writing books which is an awesome tool with
                        thoughtful AI to nudge you in the right direction, and it relies on intellectual property from
                        skills and experience to turn into media, collected data and turned into software.

                    <p>
                        The ability for demand vs supply, which is economic gravity which dictates profitability and growth
                        in a business. The thing that unravels is you think if an It company it is about IT services etc,
                        but it is about the ratio to supply and demand tension and when the value goes up the price goes up.
                        You have to figure out how to ramp up the demand of what you are going to do, so you can create
                        demand with demand side assets including videos, guides and podcasts to manufacture the demand.
                        Everything is downstream from lead generation, and this will dictate profitability from anything
                        else. Marketing trend predictor and can look at the US President election for what's the technology
                        that should be using such as from newspaper to radio or from radio to television and then for social
                        media where marketing went to instead. How did the recent election unfold with podcasts where Kamala
                        did 5 podcasts, 4 million YouTube views and 3 hours of watch time which was scripted, short and on
                        topic but Trump did 14 podcasts, 124 million YouTube views and 17 hours warmed people up to the
                        potential for voting for him so you need to be on more and more podcasts as a guest. They have been
                        on 36 podcasts and need to be on 10 podcasts per year and there are levels on the podcast pyramid so
                        if you aim for the top podcasts you won't geta response but start with the small ones and don't
                        leave them to promote it be the one who promotes these and you can finish each podcast with a call
                        to action.

                        From business brands to personal brands and personal brands are far more powerful and our brains
                        aren't built for logos but for people and we store people we might know, so to be in someone's head
                        you need to show up for seven hours in four different locations, so if they see you eleven times
                        then you start to recognise you. You need to show up as a key person of influence so need to build
                        up your personal brand and share your ideas and opinions. 1% of LinkedIn users post weekly and those
                        that do get 50% more inbound enquiries. The whole world is very negative where people say
                        opportunity is nowhere, but opportunity is now here and it is the most amazing time to be alive, the
                        ability to share a message or build an incredible business and if you surf these waves of change you
                        will have an incredible time.

                        goals and dreams, then need to stop doing it. Tips for time management and self-care is a good
                        culture and not results at all costs, processes or systems put consults in control. These include to
                        monitor where you spend your time like a daily activity log but can be pen and paper to diarise
                        everything and review this with your goals and aims in mind, the first thing to plan in is personal
                        time and it doesn't move and then add stuff you have to do and cannot be moved and can have other
                        tasks that have to be done but have flexibility such as around own self development and then have
                        things that are optional and desirable such as training for anything else make it fit into those.
                        You can feel guilty is passionate and give yourself time so to take this away is splitting the day
                        into chunks to get guilt free downtime and don't do anything work. Deadlines don't work for them but
                        it fine to have them, but jobs can be overwhelming so put them in with some wiggle room or ask for
                        tasks from others before they are due but need to put yourself first and don't accept someone else's
                        deadline. Give yourself one protected hour to achieve task and don't deviate and stay free of
                        distractions. When not at work then take yourself away and switch it off don't have work phone there
                        and don't be always accessible. Don't be frightened to ask for help, so if struggling with time or
                        tasks then ask for help and get someone to support you.

                        navigation tool that you can access anytime with guides, templates and tools along with access to
                        advisors. Their specialism of finance and funding is that they are a fund manager and deploy grants
                        and loans across the UK and also tailor support to SMEs to give right access to the right finance.
                        Businesses don't aways need funding, so the business support gives one-to-one advice and support.
                        They empower businesses to access the right funding and their mission is to simplify the journey and
                        connect businesses to the right funding and remove barriers to growth as 60% of SMEs don't know
                        where to turn for finance and it is a complex and crowded funding landscape and there is a lack of
                        tailored support where they can help demystify the process of getting funding. They will help
                        understand what businesses want, provide a business funding adviser and have a UK-wide network of
                        investors and take the hard work out of the conversations and have a skilled workforce in grant
                        field for businesses to access those grants that are available. They will understand what challenges
                        are and then diagnose their position with work and curation to then access the right place and
                        options for funding with someone to help you all the way though.

                        They have worked with a founder of an early-stage business that had been bootstrapped to a certain
                        point and were able to get innovate UK funding and then got advice on doing things in the most
                        efficient way. Accessing the best route for you for equity, debt, grant and alternative sources.
                        What is the long-term goal of the founder and business owner is determined with a conversation with
                        an advisor to make sure the route that is followed is the one towards that goal and rule out options
                        that aren't right. They are seeing a rise in blended finance as one size doesn't fit all and spreads
                        the risk and helps with co-investment and enables flexibility which can help develop products which
                        can then help, and all three main areas of funding can play a part in each stage of a product
                        development process.

                        Realise your ambitions. Ben is a former designer with over ten years of problem-solving experience
                        and over four years as a digital adoption specialist at Sunderland Software City and has designed
                        and delivered support for many wide-ranging organisations along with being founder of NESD CIC. One
                        of the main things is knowing where's the money and how to get support but it is a fragmented
                        landscape which can be difficult to navigate and realised there was a problem so founded the North
                        East Support Directory.

                    <p>
                        There is an identification problem as there are so many different opportunities out there but you
                        need to know what's out there but if don't know about something but there is a lot of happen-chance
                        discovery and for busy founders to navigate a complex landscape is difficult. There is a lot of
                        comprehension needed for a founder and can lead to overwhelm and information overload. There is
                        plenty of support available but identifying relevant support is a nightmare and there's lots for
                        business owners to consider. There are support providers who are looking to give and support seekers
                        who are looking for something but there's also factors such as discoverability and eligibility
                        criteria as grant applications can be ineligible from the start and a lot of money is wasted on
                        unsuccessful applications. People who can benefit are those who are eligible and can discover what
                        they need.

                        North East support Directory has over 2,000 opportunities, 800 grants and uses AI to scour the
                        internet for grant and loan opportunities where can have profiles for businesses and rather than
                        filters can have natural language requests of what you want where lists will be curated for
                        opportunities with any known deadlines and founders can have opportunities sent to them and can
                        share information and have a chatbot that is trained on the database of opportunities to ask about
                        funding available. The AI aggregates opportunities from all over the UK and outsourcing this to AI
                        is a really good way of going forward and you can just build an organisational profile and if any
                        opportunities that match any criteria, then will get an email so don't need to log into the
                        platform.

                        scaling an autonomous architecture and will be rebranding as a national product along with adding
                        grant writing and match making since the platform can find opportunities so this process will help
                        to apply for any grants to become an all in one opportunity finding and winning tool. They can use
                        the AI as a business listening tool to allow business support organisation to see what the business
                        community is looking for and asking for and it is free for six months for charities.

                        NEL are the only North East headquartered fund and working towards creating a North East based
                        funding ecosystem, they were established in 1989 and there have been quite a few significant changes
                        since then. NEL operator two funds with the NEL Debt Finance Fund and NEL Smaller Loans Fund which
                        are for £100,000 to £2 million for ambitious businesses that demonstrate growth potential and
                        £25,000 to £100,000 for supporting new and growing businesses that can demonstrate loan
                        serviceability. Funds can be used for many things including buying machinery or equipment and
                        launching a new product or service. They have really flexible funding and work with businesses to
                        find the right structure for them but what is key is growth and demonstrate helping the economy
                        grow.

                        a willingness to hire. Businesses need to have a sound financial position, have realistic and
                        achievable forecast and be able to support proposed level of debt through monthly cash-flow and a

                        challenge and ask awkward questions but honesty is the best policy and will have a conversation to
                        see what could work for a business as people often worry they don't have a perfect business plan so
                        can talk it though the risks including mitigation and if they aren't the right people will direct
                        them to the help a business needs.

                        Jamie and panel are here about funding and high growth and to be with people who are giving back to
                        the North East doing innovative and special things here. What does the journey look like for a
                        business. Rojin is co-founder of Polybox which is an AI data analysis platform for marketers. James
                        founded a defect management solution of clixifix which was acquired by SmartCraft group and are
                        looking at what products from there can be brought here. Connor is co-founder of OneClickComply and
                        are a cyber security company based locally. Tom is an investment manager at North Star and has been
                        involved in all those companies. Jamie is director at Sunderland Software City to drive and grow
                        North East tech sector and it is a brilliant time here in Sunderland.

                        If have a product or solution what makes you realise you need a different kind of capital to grow.
                        Rojin was not a founder before but was the level of resources they had helped them learn how to run
                        a business and know where to go but with venture capital can help you get somewhere and get there
                        fast, although it is not available for everyone, main thing is knowing what to go and those business
                        models that add value are the ones venture capitalists are looking for. Connor has worked with
                        investors and talked about their business, the culture and hiring people here in the North East.
                        James mentioned they were subject experts in construction but wanted to do something in software as
                        a service so wanted to bring in someone to help scale their intellectual property of their software
                        as a service before someone else did it before them and needed to work with someone that they could
                        get on with which was key for them to work with North Star. Tom talked about how things kick off,
                        they keep things informal as possible and get referrals and get direct enquiries through website or
                        LinkedIn but even if don't invest they will help with business plans, fund managers are very
                        relationship focused so need to see if a business has a scalable product they can deliver.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When are subject matter experts and have the money how do you know what to do. Connor mentioned part
                        of the process is having a detailed plan and spent a lot of time at who they wanted to hire to fill
                        gaps in their team, improve their office and have plans for the next year including how to generate
                        more revenue and build out their tech team but you know you have a good idea and part of getting
                        money is knowing what you can do with the money and need to keep that plan live and see where you
                        can go next. James mentioned raising capital is draining and emotionally taxing so they started with
                        a cash-burn metric to see how long they can go before running out of money but they had a team of
                        them and a developer to build the product and come up with a better process so could fully
                        understand what they were doing and grow from a team of one to a team of eight and before they
                        exited their growth was 60% per year and they key plans were focused on the growth side of things.
                        Rojin was crafting a product and speaking to customers but then there was jargon and finance so they
                        got the money, they mentioned the VC asks you to spend the money so you need to have a plan to spend
                        it which can be stressful as things are getting real and but then you realise you are being trusted,
                        you don't have the right to exist before you prove you can exist and they had incredible advisors
                        but realised there were so many parts of the business they didn't think about and need to think
                        about resilience and the plan is to grow the company, it can take a while to know how to focus on
                        growing and manage things.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tom talked about the relationship which can vary with businesses they can be more or less involved
                        can be working on business plan or putting in touch with investors but if things are going well,
                        they let businesses get on with it, they are backing people with a business plan and aren't
                        interested in micromanaging companies. Connor started to get traction and recurring business then
                        how do you evolve, when you are raising you are focusing on what the business is going to do but
                        once you raise you are selling and building product or brining people into the business so their
                        role changes between those stages between talking to investors and working on the product and being
                        responsible for business operations but their role changes every day and their responsibilities need
                        to change every single day. James for repeat customers and scaling to acquisition, how do you deal
                        with things can be a massive challenge and a founder is a very lonely role but you can tell North
                        Star many things you might not tell your family, when getting more traction in their business then
                        someone did get in touch and wanted the business but the exit will happen when it happens but the
                        important thing is to continue to do what you are doing and ensure stability for the team but also
                        not to be transparent all the time when things are happening and bring certain people in at the
                        right time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rojin was asked about wearing many hats in the business, where are focused on growing the business
                        and profile may have been raised but there may be people who come and try and waste their time, they
                        wanted to run their business was to have a transparency and conversation but this turned into
                        everything they were doing and they were chatting to people that they started to need to say no to
                        people if they weren't going to transform the business but it is worth having a conversation if it
                        is important to them but it took them a while to get where they could do that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What are the things that motivate them and what is the reason they are here with Connor is when they
                        started was knowing they building a product they knew was a good idea and although got some
                        knockbacks but the cofounders helped motivate each other and psyche themselves up but were looking
                        to achieve something together but if it didn't work they would have just gone back to corporate and
                        main thing was saying things will be okay. Tom was asked about high growth can be intimating but the
                        traits of business that makes them realise people are enjoying what they do as there are parts that
                        are enjoyable but it is an all-consuming job where you need to do everything and no one to do
                        something if you're not doing it so need to be flexible and resilient and things don't go as planned
                        so need to be able to pivot that plan if needed. Rojin is proud that if she could start again, she
                        would but most of the time you can go from something being an idea to a product to people using it
                        has joy for them, and you can see it working for them and you do learn so many things. James talked
                        about looking back that there is so much of yourself that goes into a product to scaling it to
                        hundreds of users around the UK is pretty good and the personal side is to have gambled hard to
                        start which now secures their financial future makes it worthwhile and are still enjoying it.

                    <p>
                        Is the biggest barrier to growth is people or processes but James mentioned that a good sales team
                        won't outsell the market fit so need to have the data that a product is right then it comes to the
                        processes and can look at others but with software the product has to be market ready first. Connor
                        mentioned you should know the processes, but this can change so having a team that can work to
                        create the processes that work. Rojin was obsessed with processes and culture when they started but
                        main thing is to make things work and make sure you make things work as fast as you can with the
                        right team and accept that no one has done what you have done before in the way you are doing it.
                        Tom was asked about knowledge that has been collectively shared means people have been willing to
                        give things a punt and the main thing is really understanding the pain of a problem that is trying
                        to be solved and an important thing is having the right advisors to help and support a business and
                        have someone you can trust to speak to is really important.

                        With development of AI and visual development tools has made it easier to build product so has the
                        investment profile changed, with Tom it has changed what investors are looking for so when building
                        a software product, you need someone who has that expertise or experience. Rojin mentioned for tech
                        you don't need to write everything from scratch but having someone who understands the language of
                        development is important, things that took years to make can take months so you can use AI and
                        automation to make things faster. James talked about Microsoft coming in to show off AI as
                        developers were worried about losing their jobs, but it is making them quicker. Connor the talked
                        about the ability to solve a problem is that it needs to be wanted, you still need to look at
                        whether a something is a problem that needs a solution, and you need to think about building things
                        right to solve problems in the right way.

                    <h4>The 3 Stories - Sarah Leathem</h4>
                    <p>
                        They had the building already and had a tenant but later when they left, they thought they could do
                        something with the building. Sunderland is growing with investment opportunities similar to those
                        that happened in Belfast. Their background wasn't hospitality but was as an accountant but they have
                        seen growth from a lot of sectors but moving to hospitality has been a big challenge but they did
                        market research when the building was being rebuilt was to ask what they wanted which was breakfast,
                        a selection of beers and didn't want to compete with businesses but complement them and feed off all
                        sorts of aspects including complementing shows at The Empire with cocktails.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The original building dates back to the 1700s and there is a lot of nods to Sunderland and the North
                        East in the building and tried to amalgamate a lot of Sunderland heart into the building. The bar
                        itself is three levels with food and drink along with live music on the ground floor. Second floor
                        is a sports bar and night club and then there is the top floor for cocktails along with a fairground
                        rooftop area. They have trust and support in the city and have invested in the property to grow with
                        the city, the people and local businesses and they try to use all local businesses for beer and
                        coffee where it is possible to do this. Being a business owner can be lonely sometimes, so they have
                        a team that is important which is a team they built.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Their business is predominately crowd funding and the money they do make they do invest a lot in
                        Sunderland which is a growing city and they do travel back and forth to Ireland but they do
                        genuinely love the North East, they can reach out to anyone they need to help to grow their business
                        with networking events and this event has been a massive opportunity to see what's out there and it
                        is easier to commute by flying to Sunderland from Belfast via Newcastle, Northern Ireland than it is
                        to Dublin, Ireland.

                        One in every 2,222 business ones retire when they want, how they want with what they want. Let me
                        into a little secret - you are the hero. Storytelling, business is a story, when it comes to growth
                        have to start a story with a foundation, but it starts before the numbers as people are investing in
                        the person so need to have a compelling story without which your pitch will not work, if there's
                        holes in your story you are going to lose credibility. If you are a trading business, you need an
                        accountant and need credibility with your numbers so people will invest in you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aspirations need the background for your numbers, numbers themselves tell a story, and you need to
                        look at what they mean to you. So, if making sales do you split them down, so if you need to split
                        funding with some sales but then ask if this is the most profitable thing you do and if it has
                        longevity - if it can be replaced by AI then it might not have long term longevity even if it is
                        profitable. Need to look at patterns and make sure you challenge any aspirational goals so to save
                        time when looking at growth is to look at the story. Have context which is background of what you
                        want to do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Winning and / or learning. Funding doesn't necessarily go where you need it to go, you need to have
                        the final part of the story and know where the funds should be going to what you planned on and that
                        you make those funds work for you. When you get your investment and when your recruiting and get
                        people in may take longer than you think and then they are ready at the wrong time you need to hold
                        that cost until it is so need to make sure there isn't a hole in your story and make sure you have
                        that confidence, need to find answers to questions you didn't even think to ask.
                        Need to focus on the before during and after funding. You are trying to prove three key things which
                        is sound financials and need to understand operational part of your business and make sure any parts
                        are talking to each other.
