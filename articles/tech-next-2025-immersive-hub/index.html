                        Is XR driving a revolution in patient care? - Tammy Vivian, Vikki Rand & Denis Martin
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Tammy Vivian is from GigXR which was a spinoff of Pearson publishing, they needed to make an
                        application to improve patient care without stepping foot in a hospital. They want to drive outcomes
                        such as student satisfaction and return on investment as in healthcare mannequins and role play is
                        used so want to make sure are at least achieving same outcomes with simulations. They work with
                        lecturers and more to make sure simulations are clinically accurate. GigXR simulations are
                        hyper-realistic and on Microsoft HoloLens, Meta Quest 3/3S and iOS / Android to revolutionise
                        clinical skills training and help with urgency and compassion to a virtual patient as well with XR
                        and emotional connection.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        GigXR also have other powerful strategic alliances such as with the US Army, Epi-Brain Collaboration
                        with Alaska Native Tribal Consortium along with academic partnerships where work directly with
                        hospitals and universities to customise training modules that address specific educational needs and
                        clinical requirements. They have had good feedback from partners such as Miami Dade College,
                        Ursuline College and Southern Cross University. Their immersive XR app platform includes
                        HoloPatient, HoloScenarios and Insight Series and will have Conversational AI and HoloHuman+.

                        Professor Vikki Rand is Director of the National Horizons Centre at Teesside University and is part
                        of NortHFutures which is a three-year pilot project and supported by six universities in the region
                        to tackle challenges in the region, they also facilitate digital skills sharing across different
                        areas of health. They prioritise community centred research and facilitate widening participation in
                        digital research and design innovation by diverse stakeholders. They are networking for innovation
                        and entrepreneurship. PROTO is one of those places they work with which is a home for innovation and
                        digital disruption. There are also companies like XR Therapeutics to use immersive tech to support
                        mental health to be either patient or therapist. They also work with 5G Immersive Lab which offers a
                        5G test bed and Immersive technology along with Tucan Studio for VR and XR including gamification.

                        Denis Martin is professor of rehabilitation at Teesside University and worked with consortium for
                        funding VR4Rehab, VR4Long Covid and to scale up 4Rehab. The project ran with hackathons, game jams
                        and challenges. Things which came from them include Corpus VR which is new direction for existing
                        products to use VR to help understand pain neuroscience. They worked with existing services to add a
                        new dimension to what they deliver using XR including The Pain Toolkit Caf√© for a virtual space to
                        meet together and share resources and they also worked with a company to share the tips and
                        experiences with pain.

                        Craig Gilchrist & Ashmita Randhawa
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Harvey Trent is director at Fuzzy Logic studios which builds AR and VR in North Shields and their
                        core goal is to build talent in the North East. There are numerous different challenges to unlock
                        power of immersive tech. The tech is great and what it is doing, and they need to stay current to
                        see how it will be applied in the commercial space. VR and AR have been around for a while but there
                        are still challenges. People don't understand how to use it or don't know what resources are
                        required and need to manage change when bringing in new tech and then what cost category does it
                        fall under and is the application for the business along with that return on investment does it
                        show. Dealing with a perceived risk and no budget allocation, you need to put this tech in your
                        profit and loss. The technology is there, and it is advancing. What is the right question, so what
                        if, what if your competitor does it instead. What if...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Professor Richard Laing part of Urban Futures from Northumbria University spoke about where VR and
                        AR has become normalised at a rapid pace. VR and AR in the build environment where can use laser
                        scanners which can capture version of real environment that previously would be impossible to
                        capture. No one is saying to abandon pencils and pens but can use versions of things on the screen
                        as often start with simple drawings. It is becoming increasingly normal to use large screens for
                        architecture and design process which will often help notice things that may have been missed
                        otherwise. It is normal on construction sites to have large or small screens along with augmented
                        reality on site to see what something is supposed to look like when it is finished. Conversation
                        teams can use information to help with building conversation and have a depth of information that
                        can be conveyed in a virtual way.

                        Craig Gilchrist is CTO of BeamXR which brings things from inside XR to outside XR. They have a
                        particular love of XR and people using it for the first time. Observability of XR, you can know to
                        some extent what XR game someone is playing by how they move their arms. XR is immersive, emotive
                        and social but a black box to anyone on the outside. They saw issues and heard issues with attempts
                        to solve this so was the spark to starting BeamXR and Meta had their own solution which doesn't work
                        well such as with conference Wi-Fi. They thought about gaming first as there is a lot of game
                        streaming already but streaming VR has a lot more potential and there is a lot more from just a flat
                        game so they want to bridge the gap. They chose gaming as it has demanding and passionate gamers
                        then they can bring this into and scale with enterprise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        BeamXR turns a standalone headset into a streaming studio and allow developers to set the narrative
                        where can change participant into a presenter with controllable camera angles and more. BeamXR have
                        features where viewers can see things and in VR you can see chat messages from viewers. You can open
                        up your experience and take them on your journey such as social simulations. They have learned that
                        physical presence drives social etiquette, empathy drives performance and observation changes
                        behaviour. The barrier is to scale and bring into existing e-learning platforms and can elevate
                        experience and deliver greater communication and presence and visibility makes people more effective
                        and human.

                        Laura Partridge is Associate Director for CoSTAR which is the UK R&D network for creative
                        technology. It aims to focus on huge role creative has on UK economy with focus on screen sector. It
                        is a five-year programme with five labs in the UK. It seeks to address a lot of challenges, the UK
                        is great at screen such as gaming, film and TV but where challenge is keeping on top of technology
                        such as from gaming being applied to TV and film and support SMEs who might not have access to
                        infrastructure and keep them ahead of the curve. Environmental sustainability for virtual production
                        has an impact on energy so need to use R&D to help resolve this.

                    <p>
                        Dr Vicky Williams is Policy Manager at CoSTAR Foresight Lab which looks at what challenges there
                        will be in the future. Their job is to think about implications of research about what policy
                        interventions will be needed from the government and start to think about taking existing strengths
                        and sustainability is a huge part of this. There are labs around the country that ForesightLab which
                        tracks industry insights is one with others including RealtimeLab, NationalLab which is development
                        at Pinewood Studios, ScreenLab and LiveLab. They talked about that they collect data across labs to
                        get a broad picture of what is happening including lab research on key thematic areas in
                        sustainability for technology and convergence. AI will have a massive impact and challenge for
                        screen sector. They are also running a survey with businesses across the UK to try and understand
                        what is happening on a national level. Foresight Lab is about understanding of plausible and
                        preferred futures.

                    <p>
                        Phil Adlam who is CTO of CoSTAR LiveLab talked about Carbon insights with assessment of carbon
                        impact and energy consumption across virtual production, generative AI and more. Virtual production
                        is more sustainable but there are gaps such as what sort of energy sources are powering screens and
                        how excess heat is being redirected so need to have transparency of data. There is a need to bring
                        sectors together to reduce data gaps. There have been reports on AI in screen sector where virtual
                        production will increasingly use generative AI so need to look at this in terms of sustainability
                        goals. In the screen sector there is lack of transparency for sustainability and AI along with using
                        smaller more bespoke AI models rather than larger AI models. Need to think about present challenges
                        including copyright for AI and to be a world leader need to think about sustainability. In terms of
                        future is thinking about creator led and responsible use of technology.

                        They have been doing work to make sure are feeding into policies or learning from overseas projects
                        that have sustainability at the core. Each of labs are based on places of industry. The key part has
                        been collaboration between academia and industry. There are all sorts of elements in creative
                        industry and it is key to collect all sorts of data, most sustainability data is being captured for
                        reporting but also want to know how to get better so is helpful to have data and put it into context
                        such as understanding what power is used for such as whether it is being used for things that are
                        useful or not. It is possible to take data and use generative AI to create actionable insights. They
                        have been able to demonstrate that virtual production does reduce carbon footprint and by applying
                        knowledge learned reduce average consumption of energy. CoSTAR is partnering with real world
                        challenges and solutions and want to help people with this.

                        Dr Paul Dolan got money to work with Proto and have looked into the environmental concerns with
                        virtual production and there were some gaps in knowledge research such as manufacturing and
                        materials for LED screens but there are lots of them being built in the UK. With virtual production
                        what kind of computation is happening is another question such as how images are being produced and
                        stored. There is a huge reliance on data centre compute, but the infrastructure is terrible for the
                        environment such as water supply which is a huge burden on water. Real-time rendering happens on
                        site rather than a data centre.
