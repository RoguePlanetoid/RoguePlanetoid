                                Silverlight was a framework for creating rich internet applications, but Silverlight was originally designed to deliver streaming video and later expanded to other capabilities. 
                                Silverlight eventually resulted in a platform that could be used to create applications with a great deal of functionality that was not possible at the time in browsers, except 
                                with the competition at the time Adobe Flash which was far more popular. Silverlight would be around for over a decade after first becoming available in 2007 with the final 
                                release being in 2019 although Adobe Flash only lasted a little longer up until 2020 although it had first release as Macromedia Flash in 1996! It was amazing to see Silverlight 
                                grow from the humble beginnings of using XAML and JavaScript to using a variation of .NET which made it possible to create a variety of small and large applications, this 
                                included my own along with tutorials. When Windows Phone was announced it initially used Silverlight as the basis for applications although could not display existing 
                                Silverlight content. It was with the release of Silverlight 4 where the original browser plugin reached its full and maximum potential, although there was to be another 
                                version along with Windows Phone support, but it was that version if first fully embraced and you can read about the features here available at the time.

                        <h3>Silverlight 4</h3>
                        <p>
                            Microsoft created Silverlight to help companies design, develop and deliver engaging, interactive user experiences for Web, desktop and mobile applications when online or offline. 
                            Silverlight is a free plug-in, powered by the .NET Framework and compatible with multiple browsers, devices and platforms. Bringing a new level of interactivity to wherever 
                            the Web works, Silverlight will ultimately deliver seamless experiences across PCs, TVs and phones. Silverlight 4 delivers a full suite of powerful features to application 
                            developers, bringing innovative platform capabilities to browser-based experiences. Silverlight provides an ideal platform for developing and deploying modern business 
                            applications for both internal and end-user applications on both sides of the firewall.

                            Silverlight 4 extends out-of-browser capabilities pioneered in Silverlight 3 that enable a Web presence to establish closer, more persistent 
                            relationships with customers without any additional runtime download or the need to write applications in a different way.
