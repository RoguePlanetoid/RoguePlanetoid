                        Leadership, power, stakeholder management - we are all leaders. Only successful leaders have a nose
                        for opportunity and a knack for getting things done. Understand your power and influence over a
                        project. Tend to plot where the stakeholders are and then think about strategies but we tend not to
                        think about how to influence stakeholders.

                        Organisation can be split conceptually into three layers. S - Strategic which is the top board layer
                        and those to drive strategy. T - Tactical which is middle layer which brings it into action.
                        Operational delivers the actions to fulfil the strategy and information flows up and it also flows
                        down such as feedback.

                        Change is a movement, when you think about it like “I have a dream” or women's suffrage. But it is
                        where someone has a vision and need to affect change and needed to have a movement that would then
                        affect change. Organisation change is a movement that improves the organisation's ability to deliver
                        against its obligations to its shareholders. Wanting to drive towards a certain objective and
                        influence people.

                        How to start a movement? By Derek Sivers A leader needs to have guts to stand out and be ridiculed
                        and show everyone else how to follow. First follower is another form of leadership and transforms a
                        lone person into a leader, a movement must be public, must show the leaders not just the followers
                        and people will follow the followers not the leaders, once there are more people more can follow and
                        won't stand out as much and people can stick with the crowd. When standing alone remember to nurture
                        your first few followers. Leadership is over glorified and the first follower was the one that
                        transformed that first person into a leader, have courage to follow and encourage more people to
                        follow, be the first to join in. One of the key things from Derek is you have this individual has a
                        little bit of a vision, the lone person all by themselves to influence people, and can be very
                        difficult, but for anything to occur they needed more people and just needed to influence that first
                        person to come across and have power sources to drive that kind of movement.

                        Where it all started? They worked for nPower and was in a really good place in what they delivered
                        for the company. Performance of Bulk Upload where 60% of bulk uploads into the system failed that
                        were coming in from price comparison website, they helped reduce account failures to 17% and saving
                        millions. They also worked on performance on registration where 72% of accounts were being switched
                        within 21 days but regulatory target was 89% and helped increase this to meet the target
                        consistently. Knowledge, lack of knowledge of how the systems worked and built up system knowledge
                        and became the go-to guy for switching accounts. Information - lack of access to data and they
                        managed to gain access to multiple systems and get information and be able to pull data and had a
                        great network where others who hit red tape they formed connections to get across boundaries. They
                        did quite well in terms of influence and were reviewing a situation and they will told they maybe
                        need to think about their influencing techniques, this wasn't something they needed help with, there
                        was a project that wasn't working well and was dawn of agile within nPower and they went into a room
                        in front of multiple people in the team and had a member of IT and had differences of opinion where
                        people would agree with IT but didn't really get it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They got led on a journey on what they could have done differently and started writing books by
                        Terry R. Bacon who wrote The Elements of Influence and The Elements of Power. What they had missed
                        wasn't the influencing techniques but there is a concept about power - power in people is like power
                        in batteries, the higher the voltage the more if can deliver and the more powerful you are the more
                        influence you have and influence is the application of power to accomplish a specific purpose - the
                        person in that room had more power than them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You have the power to create your own movement, they is always a responsibility on us which is E + R
                        = O which is Event - and event that is outside of your control + Response - which is what can you
                        change and this equals the Outcome. If you keep doing the same thing and you don't change but expect
                        a different outcome that's the definition of insanity. How do you change your response?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Power - five different sources of power. 1. Knowledge is your skills and abilities derived from what
                        you know and what you can do. 2. Expressiveness is how you can communicate with people and if want
                        to influence people is how you communicate in written or oral forms. 3. History if have history with
                        someone, it's not about what you know but who you know, power is derived from familiarity and trust.
                        4. Attraction is the ability to cause them to like you, personal attractiveness, authenticity,
                        commonality of values and experiences. 5. Character based on people's perceptions, integrity,
                        honesty and fairness.

                    <p>
                        Organisational power can come from your Role - it is your position whether you have to defer to
                        someone else. Resources - could be ownership of important resources including access to things.
                        Information - is access and control of information - retrieval, access, dissemination,
                        interpretation and organisation. Network - is power from breadth and quality of connections with
                        other people. Reputation - is based on estimation of overall quality of a person by others. You have
                        two currencies in an organisation which are performance and network which is building relationships,
                        and this helps build up your reputation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Will is the most important power source which magnifies every other source and based on desire and
                        courage to act and to believe you can get something done and make it happen - may often have a will
                        rather than a plan to do something. Someone says here are all the initiatives and someone says what
                        we are trying to achieve with those initiatives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Influence is the application of power to accomplish a specific purpose. 1. Logical persuading - when
                        you use logic to explain what you believe or what you want and is the number one technique where
                        vision relates to traceability. One person's logic is not the same as someone else's. Derek Sivers
                        explains logic that someone asks a question may ask what is name of block and it may not have one
                        but the street does but in Japan the streets have no names but the blocks do and the house numbers
                        go in the order they were built, realise you may have assumptions you never knew you had or pay
                        doctors when healthy and not when you are sick. If trying to explain something to someone but if
                        someone has a completely different thought it doesn't necessarily mean it is wrong, approach
                        something in a different way vs this is the way we have always done it. If we explain something if
                        they don't quite get it and often just describe it in a different way but it may still not work,
                        think about another way that may work. 2. Legitimising - which is appealing to authority but is the
                        least effective influence technique, don't quite say you are the one but say someone else and when
                        done correctly can result in quick compliance, it is not me it is the CEO who has said it for
                        example but if overused it can look like it is you who want it and just using them as an excuse. 3.
                        Exchanging is negotiating or trading for cooperation, if you do something for me, I'll do something
                        for you and often only way to gain cooperation or agreement. 4. Stating is asserting whether you
                        believe it or not with compelling tone of voice but if overused they can cause resistance, like at
                        the end of a sales pitch and then state something and asserting what you want.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are also four social techniques. Socialising - getting to know the other person, being open
                        and friendly, people are always trying to influence other people, if say “hello” to someone you will
                        be pleasant you want people to like you and is a good way to get over silos and rifts, only takes
                        one night out for people to be yeah, it's all good. Appealing to relationships- gaining agreement
                        and cooperation with people you know well. Consulting - engaging and stimulating people by involving
                        them in the problem or solutions. Alliance building - building alliances to influence people by
                        using peer and group pressure to gain cooperation or agreement but sounds negative but can go around
                        people and get their ideas and be prepared and make sure others are on the same page as you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are two emotional techniques which is appealing to values - making an appeal to someone's
                        values or an appeal to the heart, this is one of the principal ways to influence many people at
                        once. Politicians will say we know what you need and appeal to your values but whether they do it or
                        not is another thing. Modelling - may not be intentionally influence people by being a role model,
                        teaching, coaching, counselling, and mentoring and can influence people without people being aware
                        that you are influencing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Dark Side. Avoiding - forcing others to act, often against best interests, by avoiding
                        responsibility or conflict or behaving passive-aggressively, know that you are upset about something
                        or give someone the cold shoulder. Manipulating - intentionally withholding information others need
                        to make the right decision or influencing through lies, deceit and hoaxes. Intimidating - imposing
                        yourself on others, forcing people to comply, being loud or overbearing. Threatening - harming
                        others or threatening others if they don't comply and making examples so know threats are real.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Case Studies</h4>
                    <p>
                        Case Management Product - deliver in-house solution to allow business to track incidents and manage
                        risk within a one-year timescale. Background information is project sponsor had lost confidence,
                        senior stakeholders had disengaged with the project, and each had own agendas, had silos and in-team
                        conflict. Deliverables - things were too wide and too broad and requirements were not fully
                        understood, and the team were greenfield agile team with little experience. Were talking about
                        structuring tickets correctly for devs but the devs were saying to structure them as they actually
                        needed. Timescale - six months had passed, and six months left to deliver. Navigating senior
                        stakeholders with differing agendas, bringing them back into the fold and getting them to see what
                        was going on and had some meetings, built some reputational power, they disagreed with vision were
                        trying to build. TOPS which is a formula to look at how powerful are so for techniques used
                        consulting, alliance building, logical persuading and exchanging. Power sources were reputation +
                        knowledge of how to interact with departments, character to know people would have conflicts but
                        would be neutral, expressiveness to take complex information and simplify and will as may not be
                        sure how to get there but want to get it done. Skill for strongest and most used technique and
                        approach was consulting and alliance building - met with each stakeholder and understand their needs
                        and vision, it became apparent it was mostly political and a want to be consulted, just needed to
                        get their needs out and often wanted same thing as sponsor. Logical persuading - present a summary
                        and at next steering based on stakeholder needs and wants, present their needs, and wants back based
                        on their words. Exchanging - make recommendations based on finding how to proceed by agreeing vision
                        and roadmap and where each stakeholder would get what they want, when can logically see where you
                        get were you want and where there is a difference need to re-agree it and see that if it is what
                        they want and show where wants and needs would be fulfilled. Result was agreed a vision and roadmap
                        and expectations where clear, and stakeholders felt consulted and when had everyone's agreement and
                        there was no conflict. It was more of a natural thing at the time, had built up a good reputation
                        with stakeholders and realised they had more of those power sources.

                        Committing the Project Team to deliver to a tight timescale, delivery manager had agreed a
                        three-month extension which came from a meeting and was believed a year project could be done in
                        eight months and project didn't have time to waste. Techniques were stating, legitimising and
                        exchanging. Power sources were role + knowledge in terms of delivery and business and was a very
                        good communicator and had will and drive to make it happen. Skill with influence was advanced and
                        approach was stating & legitimising - meet with the entire team and make them aware what was
                        required including the deadline and let everyone know that's when had to do it for and was a time
                        for compliance rather than consultation and negotiation. Exchanging - gave options on how to support
                        the team to achieve the profile, couldn't move the time but could move the scope and increase the
                        resources in exchange for commitment. Results were project was delivered at the agreed extension
                        date, they stripped out lots of features and had a lot of people on it and team were pleased with
                        success and highly motivated for next phase of delivery and people had forgotten how anti-doing it
                        they were at the time, and wanted to go forward and deliver that as quickly as possible, this did
                        work from the delivery manager but may not have been their technique. If give people as much space
                        as they want but people will fill it.
