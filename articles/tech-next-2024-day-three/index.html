                            their energy.  This happens as they take out contracts when prices are high and for other factors and many businesses want to transition to green. Their platform allows 
                            businesses to get green energy without overpaying, their service keeps them on the cheapest green tariff and have been saving 10-20% and charge a monthly £250 fee and 
                            already have two clients with one saving over £12,000 per year on their bills. They are also working on an API to help turn off appliances to save them even more money, 
                            so they want to save companies as much money as possible on their energy bills.

                            In in the hair and beauty space many people are self employed or have a small business. An example is someone who has tried current salon software which takes 30% sometimes 
                            and this software doesn't prioritise the success of salon owners where many are paying £300 per month. People want to expand their footprint including building a brand on 
                            social media, direction relationships or other revenue streams such as workshops. They offer a branded app as a one-stop-shop for booking including products and courses and 
                            support marketing push notifications with a scalable and predictable monthly fee with the size of people's business. They have over 100 subscribers and have over 40,000 
                            active users with a successful product and are opening a round of funding to invest in their tools and keen to look into the ecommerce side of their application.

                        <h3>Don't Look, Just Listen - The City: Revolution</h3>
                        <p>
                            Don't Look, Just Listen was an immersive audio social event help at Proto in their Advanced Media Production facility in Gateshead featuring an impressive curved 
                            eight-metre-wide LED wall, but it wasn't what was on-screen that was important but what was heard instead. The LED wall featured a photograph of London but every 
                            so often the lights dipped, like the power was gone and clips from The City: Revolution, a science fiction post-apocalyptic audio experience set in the not too 
                            distant future that played booming loud in darkness of the state-of-the-art facility with sounds news reports of power outages in Birmingham, Manchester and Bristol 
                            with everyone heading to the City of London where London is the final frontier.

                            Next door to the AMP was a silent disco setup with an opportunity to hear the pilot episode, To the City of this immersive audio drama with a blockbuster sci-fi feel 
                            and impressive sound and production thanks to the work of an A-List composer and award-winning sound designer plus you'll be able to get the best sound experience with 
                            Dolby Atmos or Sony 360, but even without it this audio drama will have you hooked, enthralled and intrigued from the first listen and you'll want to hear even more! 
                            The story is like a 21st century Jeff Wayne's Musical version of The War of the Worlds but instead of fantastical and unlikely Martians it is the ever so plausible and 
                            likely scenario of what would happen when the power goes off, the lights go out and the scramble to head to the City of London - the only place left with power.

                            The City: Revolution features news reports that you could easily hear in the future, dialog that deepens your immersion, masterful music that will have you tapping to the 
                            brilliant beats with an enthralling electronic sound along with sensationally sung songs. Those who remained throughout the event were treated to a live performance of music 
                            from Episode Four with an in-darkness performance that was as sensational as it was haunting with the only the periodic flashes of a photographer's camera giving brief 
                            glimpses of the performer. By the end of the experience those who remained got an exclusive preview of the second episode which draws you further into the world, the chaos 
                            and consequences of the government turning off the national grid that only leaves those in the City of London, the ancient heart of the capital to once more be a fortress 
                            of power, but with electricity as the power and fortress of AI weapons as a defence. It was incredible to be there to hear the fantastic work of Markus Brown and Vikki Price 
                            and for those there who wanted to hear more then you can join the waiting list for season one or for those who weren't there can listen to episode one at 
                            <a href="https://www.sybilproductions.com/listen" target="_blank">sybilproductions.com/listen</a> and immerse yourself in this fabulous and fantastic experience that will have you hooked and remember 
                            the most important thing is don't look - just listen.
