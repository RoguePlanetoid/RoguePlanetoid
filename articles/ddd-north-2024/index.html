                            and attendees from all around the country, and some from outside the country! There were many sessions covering a wide variety of subjects 
                            along with an opportunity to network with fellow developers and so much more!

                        <h3>Introduction to StereoKit Mixed Reality Development - Lee Englestone</h3>
                        <p>
                            Lee Englestone works for Avanade and is the Developer Relations lead there and an MVP in Developer Technologies and Mixed Reality and have written 
                            a book .NET Developer's Guide to Augmented Reality in iOS and they have also done other talks on Generative AI.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A few years ago Oculus before they got acquired by Meta released the Oculus 2 headset and got the widest adoption, probably because you could play 
                            games, light smashing blocks with light sabres but after playing with it for a few months you put it away. They then heard about using C# and 
                            Visual Studio to create XR experiences for Meta Quest Headsets. StereoKit is still being developed despite the teams behind Mixed Reality in 
                            Microsoft being reduced.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            StereoKit at <a href="https://www.stereokit.net" target="_blank">stereokit.net</a> is a mixed reality framework for Visual Studio and C# and it supports OpenXR and can deploy it with minimal changes to Quest 1, Quest 2 
                            or even HoloLens. StereoKit also supports hands & controllers, it has more of a productivity focus so it would not be the choice for a game but has 
                            support for windows and controls in a virtual space. It has been built with minimal code in mind. You can also deploy to a simulator and when ready 
                            can then deploy to a headset and it is quick to deploy code to either a headset or simulator, Unity for example does take longer to build and deploy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            StereoKit supports hands with interfaces along with inking and windows with controls and can command things to come towards you, it can also support 
                            3D models and physics along with lighting sources that can be reacted to along with file system access.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You will need to install the .NET Multiplatform UI workload for Visual Studio along with Android SDK and will need to enable developer mode on the 
                            Headset in the Oculus app which is in the headset settings and need to allow USB debugging so Visual Studio can access the device, you also need to 
                            install the Microsoft .NET SDK along with the StereoKit templates then it is very simple to create a project, you need to name the folder to get the 
                            name of the project using the dotnet new sk-multi which will contain the C# code and the code to deploy it to the headset in two projects. If you 
                            start the project this will launch the simulator but if do everything correctly you can also see the headset itself as a target.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            SideQuest VR is recommended which will allow you to access the filesystem and stream things from the headset such as to OBS or YouTube and you can 
                            sideload APKs and can toggle certain developer settings. Simulator is easy to use, and you can navigate with ASDW keys and can use mouse to grab 
                            things like you would with your hand. After the first time you run your application it is there to be ran at any time on your headset so it can 
                            be run standalone without needing to be connected to Visual Studio.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can write minimal code in StereoKit my just using a few lines of code to initialise StereoKit and then have a Run method runs every frame for 
                            example to create a 10 CM cube using 0.1f. A lot of thought has been put into the structure of the framework, you can use if to combine a declaration 
                            and event handler for something like a button really easily. When writing WIndowBegin you need to call WindowEnd to display a window which needs a 
                            unique ID and will be the title and then pass in the pose which is a combination of the angle and position of the window and then can have the window 
                            itself be visible or not. Controls can support Unicode and there are also built in keyboards for the text controls that are used and can also use a 
                            Hand Menu which can be interacted with for either hand or both.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Meta Quest 3 supports Full Colour Passthrough, the Meta Quest 2 had grainy passthrough but the later one is better, you can toggle between both unlike 
                            with HoloLens which is stuck with just augmented reality experiences. You can enable Passthrough and have a Stepper instance to do this. There is also 
                            support for Inking in 3D space which draws a bunch of lines in 3D space but can use this for different things.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you have a Quest 2 or Quest 3 then you can try it out!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Pete Gallagher is a full stack manager at Avanade which is part owned by Microsoft and Accenture and is a Microsoft Certified Trainer and Microsoft MVP 
                            and they organise .NET Notts. Their background is electronics and IoT but is difficult to miss AI and it is part of everyone's job now and they are 
                            also a STEM ambassador.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Large Language Models are trained onto a lot of information but not your own data. What is Generative AI which is a deep prediction model and will be 
                            talking about LLMs such as Gemini which has been in the new recently or OpenAI's ChatGPT and there are models such as GPT 3.5 Turbo and DALL-E etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Azure OpenID has the same models as OpenAI ChatGPT but get security, virtual networks and private links and can have responsible AI, which is 
                            opinionated as will be limited in what way you will get data back, may not be able to ask certain questions. Microsoft and Avanade are investing 
                            into responsible AI. Azure Open AI has a multi-language SDK supported.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A World of Unstructured Data - Text, images, video, audio etc and have AI model training and powerful prediction engines, you ask a question, and it 
                            says what the next possible token is something but doesn't know what the next one is until it says it. We need a way to being our own data into these 
                            models.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Retrieval Augmented Generation - We can bring our own data to the LLMs, so query based on User Query, get responses back from database and combine 
                            this with query with AI reponse and add this to the LLM.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Azure AI Search - Need a way to break down the data known as Chunking. Azure AI Search allows you to query your data in different ways such as text, 
                            fuzzy and vector searches on this and has a multi-language SDK so don't have to use API calls. Indexes are like a database table with schemas and 
                            fields and can set a field to be filterable and can apply a facet which is all the options for a field to populate something like a drop-down box 
                            and query over this data. You can do a full-text search, vector search and hybrid search to improve ranking of results by combining mathematical 
                            search with semantic search and can do a semantic re-ranker which can rank results better to better understand what you actually want.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Vector Embeddings - Convert unstructured data to numbers that AI models that can then work over, to work out the meaning of the data. Created using 
                            an AI embedding model to create a Vector Database which are designed to do vector comparison and then compare two sets of vectors and can compare 
                            these with complex mathematics to see how close the numbers that represent different parts of the data to see if things are similar. Vectors 
                            understand the semantic meaning of your data and figure out how close things are mathematically e.g. King - Man + Woman = Queen, so you get another 
                            vector and can convert this back to text for the output. Another way to think about it is to use 3D space to plot the space of these words, such as 
                            a visualisation of words that you can then do a vector search of and see words that have similar semantic meaning are nearby each other.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            RAG in Detail - We have a front end and we connect to that to an API and connect to services such as Azure Search and Open AI, the user uploads a 
                            document which is broken up with chunking and vectors are created from the document and then can search for information using the vectors to then 
                            obtain a response based upon those documents.
                        </p>
                        <h3>May the Forms Be With You: A New Hope with Blazor Hybrid on WinForms - Don Wibier</h3>
                        <p>
                            Don Wibier works for DevExpress they are from Holland to present their talk about a new hope with Blazor Hybrid on WinForms. DevExpress are component 
                            vendor with components for WinForms, Blazor, WPF and many other languages.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are a lot of Win Forms / WPF applications that have been developed in the past and people are looking to move forward with Blazor, Web API 
                            endpoints and other stuff. You can start using Blazor in an existing application.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are help documents on creating a Windows Forms Blazor App, along with doing the same with Windows Presentation Foundation. You can create an 
                            application that takes advantage of a WebView3 which can be used in either a Win Forms or WPF project and you can also change your application to 
                            use dependency injection which you can get the package for this from NuGet to then set this up for the application. Then this can be used to provide 
                            functionality to the application which includes the Blazor Web View and can then either drag the WebView from the Toolbox using the Designer or can 
                            dynamically insert it into the application. Then you also need to change the project type to add Razor then add the wwwroot folder which is where the 
                            Blazor resources and assets can be placed including the Razor pages and the index.html.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Blazor Hybrid pages will be run natively on your machine and won't use WebAssembly, you can reference any CSS for any components that you are using 
                            such as the DevExpress components in the index.html and this will also include the blazor.webview.js to make sure it will work as expected. You can 
                            then include any Blazor components / files as needed including the _Imports.razor and any Blazor packages being used such as the DevExpress components 
                            can be referenced the same way as for a normal Blazor project so you can have everything you have in a Blazor project in a WinForms project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When using the WebView with Blazor you need to use Dependency Injection there so can provide the Service Provider from the dependency injection 
                            provider used in the WinForms application along with registering any services required for any DevExpress components you may be using. Once setup 
                            you can get a Blazor application running in a WinForms application but will need to set up the Router component first rather than use the Index 
                            so this will take care of the routing used in the application but also need to make sure that you use the correct render mode for the application 
                            as interactive mode is not supported for example.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            WinForms interaction with the Blazor components would be nice, so you could use some JavaScript methods to help with for example getting the width of 
                            the window for the Blazor application which can then be invoked from the Blazor application and then have a Button that will call this method to 
                            invoke the JavaScript to view the width of the window. You can also register a .NET Object Reference that can be invoked from JavaScript to call a 
                            method in C# and you can set this up from the JavaScript and have this attached on the first render of the page in Blazor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Within the WinForms application it would be nice to navigate between items in the Blazor application so need a mechanism to connect them together as 
                            the WinForms application is merely hosting the Blazor application but not doing anything with it, so you can create a bridge which can be a class with 
                            a reference to the Blazor Layout and Main Form which can be registered as a service and register to the main form and main layout and then reference 
                            these within the bridge class so will have a single reference for both and then can communicate between the Blazor and WinForms either way with this 
                            class that is referenced from both, so you could have a local data store for the WinForms application and could expose this to the Blazor application 
                            and have it deal with this data store.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Blazor state management is also possible with Blazor Hybrid so can use a state machine that can be injected into the application to perform state 
                            management to track if the state has changed and then indicate this state or change the state for example using a CheckBox.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Take a Note of XAML with .NET 8 - Peter Bull</h3>
                        <h4>.NET</h4>
                        <p>
                            .NET started as .NET Framework in 2002 but now .NET is the free, modern, and unified open-source cross platform framework from Microsoft 
                            that can be used to build apps and services for Cloud, Web, Desktop, Mobile, Gaming, IoT or AI. .NET 8 is the latest version of .NET released 
                            in November 2023 and is a Long-Term Support release supported for three years until November 2026 with thousands of performance improvements 
                            across the stack from code generation to just-in-time compilation. C# 12 is the latest version of C# released alongside .NET and introduced 
                            primary constructors which allow a class to be initialised using a simpler declaration of values and Collection Expressions were also added 
                            where lists of values can be set using square brackets to common collection values.
                        </p>
                        <h4>XAML</h4>
                        <p>
                            XAML is eXtensible Application Markup Language and is an XML-based declarative markup language that can define objects with rotations, animations, 
                            or other effects along with vector-based controls using styles or templates and more. XAML allows developers to decouple the design and user interface 
                            of an application from the implementation of an application including events, business objects and other code. XAML supports databinding from source 
                            values to target properties including converting values to present data to users or to allow interaction with data from users.
                        </p>
                        <h4>XAML & .NET Platforms</h4>
                        <p>
                            XAML and .NET Platforms include Windows Presentation Foundation, codenamed Avalon, first introduced XAML in 2006 part of .NET Framework 3.0 but today is still a 
                            major part of .NET 8. Windows App SDK, codenamed Project Reunion, first released in 2021 using WinUI 3 with XAML and leverages the power of .NET 8. 
                            .NET MAUI or .NET Multi-platform App UI first released in 2022 enables cross-platform development using XAML with .NET 8.
                        </p>
                        <h4>XAML & .NET Alternatives</h4>
                        <p>
                            XAML and .NET is also supported in Uno Platform, which is a free open-source platform for quickly building polished cross-platform native mobile, web, 
                            desktop and embedded apps with .NET using a modern WinUI 3-based XAML syntax. Avalonia UI which is another open-source UI framework to create 
                            multi-platform apps with .NET for desktop, mobile, web and browser using XAML based on Windows Presentation Foundation. OpenSilver is an open-source 
                            plugin-free framework for apps with .NET that run in any browser or device using XAML based on Silverlight and Windows Presentation Foundation.
                        </p>
                        <h4>XAML & .NET Toolkits</h4>
                        <p>
                            Toolkits available from NuGet providing additional functionality for projects using .NET and XAML such as Comentsys Toolkit for .NET Standard supporting .NET 8 
                            includes cross-platform functionality used for databinding useful in all XAML-based .NET applications. ModernWpfUI by Kinnara brings modern styles and controls 
                            to Windows Presentation Foundation although built-in support for modern controls is coming to WPF in .NET. Windows Community Toolkit is a collection of helper 
                            functions, custom controls and services for applications using WinUI 3 such as Windows App SDK. NET MAUI Community Toolkit is a collection of common elements 
                            that tend to be replicated across apps created using .NET MAUI.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Windows Presentation Foundation</h4>
                        <p>
                            Windows Presentation Foundation in Visual Studio allows developers to write XAML in the XAML View or developers can drag-and-drop controls, shapes and 
                            more to compose XAML in the Design View. Windows Presentation Foundation supports media elements such as vector and raster images along with audio and 
                            video plus can display lines or shapes with a variety of brushes. Windows Presentation Foundation allows developers to build Blazor Hybrid apps that 
                            run natively on Windows and allow UI to be re-used across different platforms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Windows Presentation Foundation was the first platform to introduce XAML and allows .NET 8 developers to create a WPF Application that targets 
                            Windows desktop from Windows 7 to Windows 11 with the .NET Desktop development workload installed for Visual Studio 2022. One pro is that it you can more 
                            easily to modernise legacy WPF applications with .NET 8, but one con is the reputation of being part of the legacy .NET Framework.
                        </p>

                            Windows Presentation Foundation in modern .NET is used by IDS CryScan to create a flexible application targeting Windows 7 onwards. 
                            IDS CryScan is an application where a user scans a QR code to load Lot specific information for the IDS System.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Windows App SDK</h4>
                        <p>
                            Windows App SDK uses WinUI 3, the native UI platform with modern controls and styles that embody Microsoft's Fluent Design and XAML written in 
                            Visual Studio can updated in a running project using Hot Reload. Windows App SDK supports new APIs with implementations decoupled from Windows 
                            and converged APIs that combine the APIs from its predecessor of Universal Windows Platform or UWP with Win32 APIs. Windows App SDK allows you 
                            to create a Widget provider that can handle operations in Widgets in Windows 11 created using Adaptive Cards.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Windows App SDK is the successor to Universal Windows Platform available as the Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK NuGet package and updated every six months 
                            with XAML like Windows Presentation Foundation. Windows App SDK combined Universal Windows Platform with Win32 using WinUI 3 as the user interface 
                            layer that features modern controls that use Microsoft's Fluent Design system. Windows App SDK allows .NET 8 developers to create a WinUI 3 in Desktop 
                            application for Windows from Windows 10 1809 to Windows 11 by installing the .NET desktop development workload along with the Windows App SDK C# templates 
                            for Visual Studio 2022. One pro of Windows App SDK is that it features the latest functionality from Windows 11 available to developers, but one con is 
                            that it doesn't support Blazor Hybrid.
                        </p>

                            Apple was assisted by Microsoft to create apps using WinUI 3 on Windows with Windows App SDK including, Apple Devices to manage your iPhone, iPad or 
                            other compatible Apple devices, Apple Music to listen to music and discover more music and Apple TV to watch new TV programmes or films.
                        </p>
                        <h4>.NET MAUI</h4>
                        <p>
                            .NET MAUI in Visual Studio does not have a Design View for XAML but does support Hot Reload which means changes in the XAML View can be displayed and updated in a 
                            running project on desktop or mobile. .NET MAUI can create cross-platform apps built for performance and extensibility where can define as much of your logic and 
                            user interface as possible in one place and can even use Blazor Hybrid. .NET MAUI can use the native APIs of target platforms allowing developers define platform 
                            specific behaviours on each platform to enhance functionality for that platform.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            .NET MAUI or .NET Multi-platform App UI is based on Xamarin using Mono which was first released in 2011 and then was acquired by Microsoft in 2016 to later 
                            become part of .NET as .NET MAUI. .NET MAUI uses XAML like Windows Presentation Foundation or Windows App SDK, but it has many significant differences 
                            control names, supported controls and property names. .NET MAUI allows developers using .NET 8 to create a cross-platform .NET MAUI App targeting desktop 
                            on Windows using WinUI 3 and macOS using Mac Catalyst, along with mobile on Android and iOS plius Tizen from Samsung by installing the .NET Multi-platform 
                            App UI development workload for Visual Studio 2022. One pro of .NET MAUI you can target multiple platforms not just Windows, but one con is there may be a 
                            learning curve for existing XAML developers due to the differences in .NET MAUI
                        </p>

                            NBC Sports Engine allowed NBC to share code between mobile, web and APIs to deliver an app quickly to market with .NET MAUI, Sports Engine is a team management 
                            application for iOS and Android where users can schedule team related events and can check attendance for events.

                        <p>
                            XAML Notes used a Class Library that used Packages from NuGet including SQL Lite for storing Notes, extensions for dependency injection or configuration, 
                            and my own Comentsys Toolkit to provide Data Binding for the various platforms. Windows Presentation Foundation used ModernWpfUI to create a modern looking 
                            experience almost identical to that used in Windows App SDK. Windows App SDK used mostly built-in functionality but did leverage a colour helper from the 
                            Windows Community Toolkit and .NET MAUI used a cross-platform popup control provided by the .NET MAUI Community Toolkit.

                            .NET 8 is the latest version of .NET that was released in November 2023 and allows developers to build modern applications and services for any platform. 
                            XAML allows developers to create modern applications with decoupled user interfaces including support for data binding for interaction with values from code. 
                            Windows Presentation Foundation allows developers to build a WPF Application targeting Windows 7 to Windows 11 using XAML, .NET. Windows App SDK allows 
                            developers to build a WinUI in Desktop application using XAML and .NET for Windows 10 1809 to Windows 11 and .NET MAUI allows developers to build cross-platform 
                            applications for desktop on Windows and macOS or mobile on Android and iOS.

                        <p>
                            I for one would like to welcome our new robotic overlords! Dylan will be talking through Copilot Studio which is a low-code solution and how it hooks 
                            into the rest of the development stack. Dylan Hayes and recently made an MVP and is a Microsoft 365 Consultant.

                            A story about a hammer - there is an interesting story about Luddites, but they were very different to what you think, and they were skilled artisans 
                            and took many years to learn how to make a certain cloth very smooth and a machine was invented that made them irrelevant, they had been highly paid, 
                            and they smashed machines and burnt down factories. As technical people we see AI as a threat, if a machine came along and made you irrelevant then 
                            you may think that way. Luddites went on to become millwrights who designed new machines and many of them went on to become the people who looked 
                            after the machines that replaced them.
                        </p>

                            Microsoft is unifying end user AI under "Copilot" which is one name for everything instead of everything having a different name. There are different 
                            capabilities of a lot of these Copilots as there are any many to Copilot in different products. There is one place to extend them all, is Copilot 
                            essentially Clippy version three.

                            Copilot Studio was announced at Ignite 2023 and allows for Power Virtual Agents for scripted conversations around topics, generative AI features 
                            which can be glued into features of chatbots on websites or social media plus can pass along to a real person with Agent Transfer and can build 
                            custom GPTs and can be surfaced as a custom Copilot which can be experts in certain domains and can't answer other things or can have integrations 
                            with Azure Open AI along with plugins for Dataverse and Microsoft 365.
