                            and attendees from all around the country, and some from outside the country! There were many sessions covering a wide variety of subjects 
                            along with an opportunity to network with fellow developers and so much more!

                        <h3>Introduction to StereoKit Mixed Reality Development - Lee Englestone</h3>
                        <p>
                            Lee Englestone works for Avanade and is the Developer Relations lead there and an MVP in Developer Technologies and Mixed Reality and have written 
                            a book .NET Developer's Guide to Augmented Reality in iOS and they have also done other talks on Generative AI.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A few years ago Oculus before they got acquired by Meta released the Oculus 2 headset and got the widest adoption, probably because you could play 
                            games, light smashing blocks with light sabres but after playing with it for a few months you put it away. They then heard about using C# and 
                            Visual Studio to create XR experiences for Meta Quest Headsets. StereoKit is still being developed despite the teams behind Mixed Reality in 
                            Microsoft being reduced.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            StereoKit at <a href="https://www.stereokit.net" target="_blank">stereokit.net</a> is a mixed reality framework for Visual Studio and C# and it supports OpenXR and can deploy it with minimal changes to Quest 1, Quest 2 
                            or even HoloLens. StereoKit also supports hands & controllers, it has more of a productivity focus so it would not be the choice for a game but has 
                            support for windows and controls in a virtual space. It has been built with minimal code in mind. You can also deploy to a simulator and when ready 
                            can then deploy to a headset and it is quick to deploy code to either a headset or simulator, Unity for example does take longer to build and deploy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            StereoKit supports hands with interfaces along with inking and windows with controls and can command things to come towards you, it can also support 
                            3D models and physics along with lighting sources that can be reacted to along with file system access.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You will need to install the .NET Multiplatform UI workload for Visual Studio along with Android SDK and will need to enable developer mode on the 
                            Headset in the Oculus app which is in the headset settings and need to allow USB debugging so Visual Studio can access the device, you also need to 
                            install the Microsoft .NET SDK along with the StereoKit templates then it is very simple to create a project, you need to name the folder to get the 
                            name of the project using the dotnet new sk-multi which will contain the C# code and the code to deploy it to the headset in two projects. If you 
                            start the project this will launch the simulator but if do everything correctly you can also see the headset itself as a target.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            SideQuest VR is recommended which will allow you to access the filesystem and stream things from the headset such as to OBS or YouTube and you can 
                            sideload APKs and can toggle certain developer settings. Simulator is easy to use, and you can navigate with ASDW keys and can use mouse to grab 
                            things like you would with your hand. After the first time you run your application it is there to be ran at any time on your headset so it can 
                            be run standalone without needing to be connected to Visual Studio.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can write minimal code in StereoKit my just using a few lines of code to initialise StereoKit and then have a Run method runs every frame for 
                            example to create a 10 CM cube using 0.1f. A lot of thought has been put into the structure of the framework, you can use if to combine a declaration 
                            and event handler for something like a button really easily. When writing WIndowBegin you need to call WindowEnd to display a window which needs a 
                            unique ID and will be the title and then pass in the pose which is a combination of the angle and position of the window and then can have the window 
                            itself be visible or not. Controls can support Unicode and there are also built in keyboards for the text controls that are used and can also use a 
                            Hand Menu which can be interacted with for either hand or both.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Meta Quest 3 supports Full Colour Passthrough, the Meta Quest 2 had grainy passthrough but the later one is better, you can toggle between both unlike 
                            with HoloLens which is stuck with just augmented reality experiences. You can enable Passthrough and have a Stepper instance to do this. There is also 
                            support for Inking in 3D space which draws a bunch of lines in 3D space but can use this for different things.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you have a Quest 2 or Quest 3 then you can try it out!
                        </p>
