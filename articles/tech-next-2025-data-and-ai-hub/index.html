                        Build a Podcast AI with Blazor using GitHub Models - Peter Bull
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Podcast AI with Blazor using GitHub Models was my own workshop available from <a href="https://tutorialr.com" target="_blank">tutorialr.com</a> which
                        has other workshops along with talks and tutorials as co-founder of Cluarantonn which helps people
                        start, grow or feature on a podcast along with connecting people with podcasting or related services
                        and with group or one-to-one support plus regular free monthly events. You can find out about all
                        this and more at <a href="https://cluarantonn.com" target="_blank">cluarantonn.com</a>.

                    <p>
                        Podcast AI with Blazor using GitHub Models involved building Blazor Podcast AI by setting up .NET 
                        which includes Blazor and the Visual Studio Code editor along with using GitHub Models accessed 
                        with a new or existing GitHub Account to provide the AI functionality to produce an AI-powered 
                        podcast assistant that could be modified to become a custom AI powered assistant. The workshop 
                        can be found at <a href="https://tutorialr.com/workshops/blazor-podcast-ai" target="_blank">tutorialr.com/workshops/blazor-podcast-ai</a>.

                    <p>
                        The workshop involved getting setup and started with .NET, which is the free-to-use platform to
                        create web, mobile and desktop applications from Microsoft. .NET can target Windows, macOS, iOS,
                        Android and Linux and can be built using the innovative and easy-to-learn C# programming language
                        plus .NET allows existing functionality to be integrated using packages. You can find out more about
                        .NET, including where to download the latest .NET SDK at <a href="https://dot.net" target="_blank">dot.net</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Blazor which is part of .NET is for building modern interactive web applications that deliver
                        content for browsers using HTML and CSS that is enhanced with C# to create dynamic web applications.
                        Blazor applications can be created that run in a web browser, on the web with ASP.NET Core or both
                        and supports components that can be used throughout web applications and packages to integrate
                        existing functionality. You can find out more about Blazor at <a href="https://blazor.net" target="_blank">blazor.net</a>.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Packages can be used to integrate functionality such as Microsoft.Extensions.AI.OpenAI that allows
                        you to use AI models from OpenAI with features such as chat with models such as the fast and
                        cost-efficient GTP-4o Mini that supports text inputs and responses. Packages can be consumed or
                        produced via NuGet which is the central location for packages. You can find out more about packages
                        available at <a href="https://nuget.org" target="_blank">nuget.org</a>.

                        Visual Studio Code is a free code editor supporting every major programming language including C#
                        that reduces overwhelm with a clean and friendly interface and even supports extensions that provide
                        functionality such as AI-assistance with GitHub Copilot and is supported on Windows, macOS and
                        Linux. You can find out more about Visual Studio Code at <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank">code.visualstudio.com</a>.

                        GitHub is an online platform for developers to store, manage and collaborate on code projects that
                        can be shared publicly or privately along with being able to track or revert changes or contribute
                        to improvements with pull requests where other developers can fix issues. You can find out more
                        about GitHub at <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">github.com</a>.

                    <p>
                        GitHub Models is a platform that allows developers to experiment with a free catalogue of AI models
                        including those from OpenAI to prototype applications such as models that power services such as
                        ChatGPT to generate responses based on user input that can be accessed with a Personal Access Token
                        from a GitHub Account. You can find out more about GitHub Models, including a playground to try out
                        models at <a href="https://github.com/models" target="_blank">github.com/models</a>.

                        Class in C# groups together code and can represent real-world objects with properties for example a
                        Car class could have properties for colour or number of doors. Methods can be used within a class
                        and are blocks of code that perform an action, and these can be used in a class or a component which
                        are self-contained elements that display content for browsers using HTML and CSS with logic using
                        code in C# that can be updated without refreshing the browser.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Prompts such as system prompts define how an AI model behaves and guides responses, they include
                        establishing the role, how the model should communicate along with format of responses and there are
                        user prompts to help define, refine or provide more context along with being able to structure
                        prompts with questions and answers to then change any answers or expand on responses.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Updating a system prompt will dramatically change the behaviour of an AI from being a podcast
                        assistant to something else, the system prompt can be changed to create an AI-powered assistant to
                        help with anything along with being able to change the type, content and tone of responses such as
                        for social media posts or even have fun with model behaviour such as getting it to talk like a
                        pirate.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Podcast AI with Blazor using GitHub Models was a great opportunity to install the .NET SDK which 
                        includes Blazor and the Visual Studio Code Editor along with leveraging AI functionality from 
                        GitHub Models using a personal access token from a new or existing GitHub Account. It involved 
                        implementing a provider class with the functionality needed to use the AI model, add components 
                        to interact with or output from the AI model to be able to generate, refine or expand on podcast 
                        ideas plus be able to customise the podcast assistant to create any AI-powered assistant.

                    <h3>AI agents: opportunity and threats - Gordon Murray & Marianne O'Loughlin</h3>
                    <p>
                        AI systems are designed to autonomously make decisions that are non-deterministic to perform actions
                        and roles. If you wanted to deploy an agentic AI for customer support to increase customer
                        satisfaction you could articulate the role, the outcomes and how you want it to work and give it
                        access to tools and integrations to help with resolution of tickets direct to customer or escalate
                        to agents and work with uses without a line of code if needed to create digital coworkers that don't
                        need to eat or sleep but do need supervision.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You have Sam Altman from OpenAI and Microsoft and others talking about Agentic AI about absorbing
                        this into platforms and software delivery tools and operations. Many organisations are thinking
                        about helping organisations to adopt AI, but few organisations are putting in place guardrails to
                        make sure they do the jobs they have been created to do. Agentic AI are reasoning loops in a
                        continuous cycle for high level objectives and agents translate these into sub goals and steps they
                        need to take and maintain memory they need to take and then refine future steps.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Why all the hype? Agentic tool chains have been around but the lack of capabilities in frontier
                        models has slowed progress but in last six months it has exploded to leverage this functionality and
                        reduce burden on people to allow them to do more creative things. AI agents are expected to be one
                        third of enterprise applications in 2028 which as 1% in 2024 and everything will be impacted by
                        agentic AI.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Agentic AI can work 24/7 with no breaks and potential cannot be understated such as scheduling
                        appointments, reminding about medications for patients or for financial services to automate claims
                        and adjusting risk models as new information comes in or help navigate government services and
                        personalise information on behalf of users.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Implementation with organisations who start their journey with simple use case and as confidence
                        grows can then expand upon this to see what parts of the organisation it can be used for. Good
                        guardrails and monitoring are critical success factors into getting real insight which can be hard
                        with thinking models not being able to tell you what you are thinking. Guardian agents can be used
                        to intercept bad behaviour but there are also meta review agents to monitor the way agentic workflow
                        is happening and feed this back into context and refining as you go.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each agent is given a specific role in the workflow where can use supervisor pattern to manage all
                        other agents and entire process and treats agents like a specialist member of a team and keeps an
                        audit trail of each part of the task. There could be rules agents, domain specific language models
                        for different reasons or might not be another model it is connected to it might be looking at
                        database or backend system to narrow down to systems they need. Meta review agent critiques agents
                        and performs corrections and risk management decides outcome where human interaction is at point
                        such as risk escalation to the human in the loop which could be a dashboard or report.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Challenges and risks where agentic AI have same risks as generative AI, but with agentic AI the
                        human in the loop isn't as present as not managing this directly. Need to balance opportunities of
                        agentic AI with challenges and risks, are you sharing data with the model in a way that is private,
                        who is accountable and what are legal implications if it gets it wrong. How could bad actors misuse
                        or use the service, the new opportunity to automate workflows but websites could do prompt injection
                        into your workflow to extract information from your organisation.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One thing is understanding degree of reliance of agents and how much trust in what they do, how well
                        they do in that role and could have a simple agentic workflow to begin with and could ensure that
                        data is good as if it is bad then the decisions will be bad, choosing the right shape and size of
                        large language model where using a generalised large language model might not be the right choice.
                    </p>

                        Thinking about the business value with the AI value pyramid is moving up the maturity scale and the
                        business potential is huge such as business critical processes but this can take a bit of time so
                        there is a maturity burden as you scale so need to make sure making the right choices for business
                        and users, in terms of compliancy, transparency and trust and more human controlled is removed the
                        better your plan needs to be.

                    <p>
                        When introducing AI agents, you are essentially redesigning your business so this needs to be
                        strategically planned and needs deliberate change management and need to deal with concerns and talk
                        to your workforce and need to make sure platforms are scalable and can be integrated. There are job
                        roles that didn't exist before so need to think about the AI product roadmap and this isn't just an
                        AI project but reaches wider with dedicated people and budget for process to take from pilot to
                        scaling up, start small and learn fast and choose use cases that will work best for your business.

                        People-centred adoption, where Opencast looks at what is problem to solve and what is best way to
                        solve the problem. When adopting AI agents ethically need have clear policies along with dedicated
                        people for compliance and the landscape for this is changing rapidly and for transparency AI agents
                        have to show how they reach conclusions. For business need to bring people with you and have
                        leadership models for key decision making and have feedback channels for domain experts. People
                        centred implementation means you need to constantly assess what you are doing for people in an
                        organisation.

                    <p>
                        You need to deal with non-technical stakeholders and define what agents are without them being
                        people but define personas which outlines in non-technical terms the goal of the agent and what they
                        can and cannot do which is good for cross-team working when bringing technical and non-technical
                        people together. You need to consider when driving things out at scale, there are potential pitfalls
                        when navigating way through agentic Ai but there are opportunities when adopting agentic AI, be
                        brave, experiment, start small and scale out but most importantly think of challenges.

                        AI Voices That Engage: How Voice Direction Can Enhance Speech Models & User Trust - Nic Redman
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Nic introduced the session and said they wanted to welcome everyone there and asked if anyone had
                        experience of AI voice and those who are involved in tech and AI. Eight years ago, they were working
                        on a Voice Over Social podcast and at the time was in turmoil as Ai voices had arrived and had heard
                        about an AI voice which was intensely realistic. They were renowned about getting to the bottom of
                        things and looked into the AI voice which even then sounded realistic.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now they are still a voice over artist and are now a highly qualified voice nerd and voice coach and
                        AI voice now should be better but there is an inconsistency as they had an example of a Car AI that
                        wasn't great using the latest technology. With AI voice models we will get there, the tech and
                        algorithms are improving at an exponential rate. Has the process of collecting voice data kept up or
                        are we relying on the tech to do this instead.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nic was lucky enough to be on a text to speech project on an AI assistant with a brief for a
                        specific volume range, specific tonal quality and emotional energy sounded consistent and neutral
                        with random sentences but their role was making sure the voice was consistent, but this was a long
                        project so needed to do vocal health due to range of voice needed. There was a different process
                        eight years ago which was pushed like actors and emotionally rigorous but produced a tonal and
                        realistic voice.                        
                    </p>                        
                    <p>
                        Voice directors have been used to then and now and it is not new to find this successful as success
                        of AI models depends on the quality of the data going in, so if the data going in isn't expressive
                        the AI will be boring as well. How can we prepare that data better and more rigorously. Need someone
                        who shapes voice as it goes in it comes out well.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What is with the AI in their car, was it pulling in the wrong phoneme, or did it not have the right
                        phoneme in the first place? The interesting thing where you can refine the synthetic voice and
                        before it gets to the public with voice direction for the performance itself or bring them in
                        earlier to structure phrases in a more conversational way at the scripting stage or who is phoning
                        it in when they made a specific sound. Ensure the creative and linguistic expertise is brought in
                        early before it is too late.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nic asked if anyone had been fooled by an AI voice, the voice sounded convincing but the content it
                        said was said in the same way. Can you be fooled with an AI voice, how can you tell if something is
                        AI, is it the algorithm or is it the input data. You can't talk about voice in AI without ethics,
                        such as those voice over artists who have had their voices scraped to be used.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Creation of AI voices for original input data is more important than ever and dupe us into believing
                        it, you might even have AI voices trained on an AI voice but if you are going to create something
                        that is good you have to invest in good quality data. What is it that people want from their AI
                        voices, do they want bespoke and not sound like anyone else and the tech is phenomenal but with all
                        that tech are we forgetting what makes it work, it is the quality of the data that needs to be in
                        line with the tech.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Are we involving directors at the right point and can they stop low quality voice output happening.
                        There is a bigger existential question is the immediate influence is humans, people with Botox are
                        using ability to empathise as they cannot move their face. The media we listen to impacts our
                        communication and it always has done, it could be American accents influencing the way we speak,
                        people could grow up listening to inconsistent AI voices and start speaking like them. We have a
                        responsibility to ensure we are representing communication in the right way.

                    <p>
                        We need to understand the process and understand the potential of AI. Algorithms everywhere such as
                        Netflix in 2007 to curate lists but they are also used behind the scenes to make sometimes life or
                        death decisions, when apply for personal finance you get an instant decision or when turn up to
                        hospital it will decide for you to be admitted based on requirements, for fraud detection and
                        management along with job screening.

                    <p>
                        AI hype includes talking about a computer that can be conscious of its own existence and reproducing
                        itself which was description of Perceptron which was a computer in 1958 which could be taught to
                        learn shapes without having the shapes programmed into it, was limited by the technology and large
                        language models imply a lot of processing power. Foundations were laid in the 1950s but it went
                        quite for fifty years until the development of imagenet in 2009 which had a good set of training
                        data for visual recognition. Moved from CPU processing to GPU processing which became ubiquitous in
                        2017 and then there was the big data era to provide massive datasets.

                    <p>
                        Innovations include deep learning which is a subset of machine learning that mimics human brain
                        structure and function which includes weights to get the outcome and if not passes this back with
                        different weights to get the desired outcome. Deep learning has a concept of different layers which
                        in the visual model is different visual concepts and they get increasingly sophisticated from
                        pixels, edges right to identity of an individual.

                    <p>
                        Innovation from classification to generation by starting from tag and getting to an image, start
                        with an image and adding random noise to an image to get back to an image and then can take noise
                        and get this back to an image which sounds simple but works better than expected and this can apply
                        to video which have models that eliminate flickering and has consistent content. This can produce
                        reasonably convincing results.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Innovation includes transformer architecture for text, which is different from images as they can
                        have near and far relationships and it can be hard to process as with images spatial correlation is
                        really high. Google had idea of attention mechanisms which has linguistic associations and higher
                        level with characters, locations and narrative arts but this required a lot of processing power, it
                        takes a trillion calculations to get the next word from ChatGPT. If trying to train a model then
                        someone has to go through and see if it is correct and give it feedback which takes a lot of time,
                        but what is easy is you can see what the next word is in sequence, given a prompt what is the next
                        likely word.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another innovation was fine tuning which starts with a pretrained model which learns language
                        patterns by guessing next word, then you add fine-tuning to refine the model with supervised
                        learning to then follow or reinforcement learning which takes this concept further where a human
                        scores an output to see if it is right, accurate and helpful and the model can use this to adjust
                        weights to be more in line with what a human would expect and it wasn't until this was added that we
                        got the capabilities.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ChatGPT would be good at chess as chess games, books and articles is in there but noughts and
                        crosses has hardly any discussions, AI answers confidently so the model will never say it doesn't
                        know but it will give you an answer, it isn't doing anything wrong but is making a prediction which
                        gets it right more than it gets it wrong.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        AI reliability problem means it is hard to know what it would do and bad predictions can be limited
                        in training data, including if there are changes so the training data is different to the
                        environment. Lack of transparency with why predictions have been made, and people have figured out
                        if you have shelves behind yourself on a video you'll do better. There's a risk of using AI without
                        oversight including where a tax authority had child benefit claims that were being accused of fraud
                        without any evidence with strong racial bias where people were disproportionately affected. There is
                        also data leakage where AI has access to privileged information with information not available in
                        the real-world has been included in the training data.

                    <p>
                        Predicting social outcomes can be challenging, they had a model provided with 10,000 data points and
                        were comparing this model against a simple four-data point base-line model and had 160 teams but the
                        outcome was the vast majority was 50% accurate but nothing out performed the basic models even with
                        more data available, so this is hard but it doesn't stop people trying this for criminal outcomes
                        but it is difficult.

                        Believe housing AI use cases are to use large language models to automate chatbots and also classify
                        complaints such as someone complaining about a repair, also using Microsoft Copilot across the
                        organisation and have chatbots for HR advice and automation for child benefit for sharing
                        information but longer term want to use AI in a predictive way using smart sensors to help make
                        early interventions and help prevent issues.

                        They have a risk assessment for AI models, so they need to be transparent and accurate to explain
                        decisions and bias mitigation with diverse training data, inclusive design teams and regular
                        fairness audits along with human oversight with critical decision review, compliance with data
                        privacy regulations and valid reliable results.

                        Impact on work, there is a pilot shortage, so Airbus and other airline operators are working to
                        remove the copilot on aircraft for single pilot operations. Banking is using AI chatbots to handle
                        many routine enquiries and offer tailored recommendations which generates more revenue and got

                        Next generation AI which is decreasing the cost of ownership of models for example DeepSeek R1 which
                        contained innovative features with chain of reasoning and mixture of experts for different parts of
                        models to solve different problems and have a model which is a 100th size of GPT so needs less
                        hardware so you may be able to run models on modest hardware such as desktops where instead of using
                        generative AI will be using own custom models. Agentic AI which is layering strategy and planning
                        capabilities on top of existing models which is an AI system that uses other AI tools to plan and
                        execute other processes such as smart assistant to come up with a plan and then execute this plan.

                        Consciousness and superintelligence with AI, AI does not think the way we think, it is calculating
                        and crunching numbers, intelligence is not an all or nothing thing it is a scale and because AI can
                        grasp the environment it is on this scale somewhere. Will AI reach human intelligence is if not when
                        but the pace of change and ability to scale up will be a single event and then after that will get
                        genius level and beyond. This could be in the next few years or decades but depends on breakthroughs
                        that have not yet happened. Physical AI is hard, such as robotics and self-driving cars are taking
                        much longer to deliver on the promises.

                        and there is a lot that will come from China and AI will change the nature of jobs and sooner than
                        people may think so need to learn as much about the technology and prepare as much as possible.

                    <p>
                        Elisio has worked for Accenture for five years and holds a masters in AI has worked on delivering AI 
                        and electronic solutions for over a decade. There are people working with AI and in the field of AI. 
                        Will be looking at where AI delivers real value and where others fail and where to apply these technologies. 
                        Peak of inflated expectations include AGI or AI will take all jobs. There are two extremes that AI is 
                        overhyped or underdelivering. Many projects have been abandoned but Ai is transformative, but it isn't 
                        magic it can automate, accelerate and augment but it needs clean data, well defined goals so need to 
                        treat it as a tool where it can deliver massive value but if treat as a miracle will be disappointed. 
                        The problem-first mindset is starting with what problem, identify pain pints, link to business outcomes
                        and avoid tech-first thinking then evaluate AI tools that can help with this. AI technologies are
                        all about a mindset.

                        OCR is optical character recognition which converts scans into data and has been around for decades,
                        but AI has made a big difference to reduce manual entry to digitise text and understand structures
                        such as tables, checkboxes, signatures and more which works really well and can work in any industry
                        that works with paper. Structured Text Intelligence is finding meaning in text where can extract
                        names, dates and organisations to enrich unstructured content and can also detect personally
                        identifiable information and can be used in applications for contracts, support tickets and more.
                        Generative potential includes drafting content can be drafting content, summarising documents,
                        coding and more but have to be careful as these models think they know things so if you don't check
                        there may be something in there you don't expect and when deployed into a live enrichment have guard
                        rails and direction about how the AI should behave.

                        LLMs and real data is useful for retrieving from a knowledge base and using LLMs that use retrieved
                        context and answer with the most relevant information for your query, you will give context such as
                        what is needed for the answer to a question which can reduce hallucinations and increase trust.
                        Agentic AI is the next layer which uses agents which plan and execute multi-step tasks, but this is
                        still in progress as don't quite have best solution but will be able to have whole workflows
                        automated but agents are a good and interesting technology.                        
                    </p>                        
                    <p>
                        What really matters is having the right problem-first mindset not trend-chasing and then the cost vs
                        benefit that is AI the best return on investment for the task and can it scale affordability as AI
                        is not free as needs a good infrastructure to run and these models are quite heavy and need a lot of
                        resources, so need to make sure it makes sense and it is better than a simpler solution. AI is as
                        good as the data it receives with idea of trash in and trash out so have good data to work with
                        these models and protect privacy and need to make sure what you are doing is right and are doing the
                        right thing and know where your data goes.

                        Erin hosted the panel discussion, Danielle has been with Accenture for six years and their
                        background is computer science and has been working with machine learning for four or five years and
                        worked on different projects with a variety of clients. Rohan has been with Accenture for ten years
                        and has spent a lot of time in public service and has built automations and AI tools for public
                        service clients and is enthusiastic about the tech stack including machine learning.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Erin asked if anyone had any questions and one was what applications have been worked on for the
                        public sector, which is nervous about deploying AI tools so is a challenge to gain trust of client,
                        but have build credibility and then can create automations for a public service client, could also
                        be used to detect fraud and other purposes. Elisio talked about a generative AI for DWP which was
                        first for a public sector client and in AWS in the United Kingdom where DWP receives unclassified
                        letters with forms and this solution can read these letters and understand what they are about to
                        classify them or identify vulnerable people to escalate cases to get the support they need,
                        processing these letters at speed is important as these people were so desperate they may just give
                        up so allows them to be supported quickly.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Danielle mentioned that one of the things around explosion of AI was open-source tools such as
                        Hugging Face is a catalogue of AI models you can find the code to run the models with explanation of
                        the model and what it is doing and can find use case for a model or not the model you will find the
                        use-cases and how to use this in AWS, Google and Docker. They use Python and Jupyter notebooks to
                        run models but can also use Google Colab with access to higher specification machines or can pay for
                        even higher usage and can use it out of the box.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The panel was asked how much has personal workload been taken with keeping up to date and to know
                        enough about technology to pitch to clients? Rohan mentioned they are focused on delivering on
                        clients so need to keep up themselves such as when Deepseek was available and every other LLM, so
                        the team is working on specific use-cases, so they try to keep up with understanding and it is a
                        proven technology, but it depends on how risk adverse clients are. It took a while to recommend
                        something like Amazon CodeWhisperer that can write code on its own, but it boils down to who you
                        recommend a solution to. Elisio said it depends on how much time you have to look at information
                        such as news, following blogs and understanding what is going on so you have to keep yourself online
                        and keep checking and testing things.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Danielle talk about how many rules does it take to solve a problem and if it is reasonably
                        manageable then AI isn't the right choice but if you don't know, or you need something to think
                        consciously based on stuff you didn't know then you could design a system like this with machine
                        learning, you can also have a feedback loop where iterate over the data.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Erin asked what most creative and surprising thing was, which from Danielle who was trying to create
                        some synthetic data to run through their systems for bank documents but created images of banks
                        instead. Erin tried to create their own GPT for their team as an advice-giving tool, but it would
                        add answer slyly or sinister laugh and they couldn't figure out how to get rid of this. Rohan talked
                        about a non-existent car auto show which seems like a real car show and trying to use the same exact
                        prompt it wasn't creating the same volume but took lots of iterations but used up all the credits
                        they had.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Danielle mentioned that they use Figma which has an AI attachment tool where would design an
                        application where the code can be generated from the design, there is a lot of resistance by clients
                        to let the application do this especially in public sector they don't like code being generated with
                        Copilot, they are getting more accepting, but developers don't often write the best code so the
                        models have been trained on this. Rohan mentioned latest tech trends is about companies writing code
                        with AI and Facebook mentions that half of their code will be created with AI which may increase in
                        the future.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The panel were asked if AI is stealing jobs? Rohan mentioned it is more of a case of reskilling,
                        this happened from moving to automation before, so it will be doing an assessment of reskilling of
                        the workforce to make people AI literate and people can find their niche in terms of reskilling.
                        Elisio doesn't believe AI will end the job of developers but developers that don't have AI skills
                        those will be replaced by those who have those skills, they have been using AI to develop and it is
                        awesome as long as it has clear instructions and is not something really new as they haven't seen it
                        create something that no-one has seen before but what is there and needs to reason and recombine is
                        awesome. Erin mentioned she has seen new roles that are being created out of necessity and that have
                        a responsibility to take people along for the journey.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Advice for those out of college from Danielle is that Accenture is actively recruiting junior and
                        apprentice engineers and the space is still there for graduates and you have to stay on board with
                        AI technology and do their own learning and research to stay competitive as it is fast moving and
                        constantly moving, so there needs to be a real passion there along with seeing AI as a tool.
