                            All of us who deploy AI must do this responsibility and as progress is made and this next generation of AI will unlock potential 
                            and allow us to rediscover the joy of computing. Today is the start of the next step in this journey of making accessible Copilots 
                            that can be used with natural language and it will be difficult in the future to imagine a world without Copilots.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Future of Work</h4>
                        <p>
                            Work not only feeds our families it needs to feed our souls. We spend too much time on the drudgery of our work and not enough on the 
                            soul of our work and need a whole new way of working. Microsoft is embarking on journey to rediscover the soul of work with Microsoft 
                            365 Copilot which is your Copilot for work, to turn your words into the most powerful productivity Copilot on the planet within Word,

                            to help send the email and you can even make what has been generated more concise. Whatever Copilot generates you can easily 
                            re-write such as in PowerPoint to get the presentation and content you want. The average person uses only 10% of what PowerPoint 
                            can do but Copilot can unlock the other 90%. Microsoft 365 Copilot can combine information from other Microsoft 365 documents,
                            presentations, OneNote notes and more.

                            and it can even suggest additional things that can be added to document in Word and even generate these for you to help write 
                            a proposal for a client in Word and you can use Copilot to create a PowerPoint presentation from a document or even a 
                            PowerPoint into Word. You can ask Copilot to make changes to a presentation such as adding animations and generating speaker notes.

                            and can answer questions about data in a spreadsheet and you can get step-by-step breakdowns of how Copilot summarised information.
