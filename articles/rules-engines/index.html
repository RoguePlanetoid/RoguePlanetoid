                        <h3>What are Rules Engines?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Rules Engines are systems that allow a set of actions to be defined based on a set of specific conditions, these could be configured at runtime 
                            without needing to change the business logic of an application. Often, when implementing an application any business rules are coupled to those 
                            use-cases present at the time of development. However, requirements can and will change so Rules Engines allow you to create implementations that 
                            are the same regardless of any use-cases for the application.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Why should you use a Rules Engine?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Developers will create a rule-based system in their application now, even without realising it when you change the flow of an application with an if 
                            statement or a switch statement. However, this control flow is hardcoded into the system and ideally you may want to make changes to enforce new rules 
                            or even remove existing ones, but this can be difficult without impacting the functionality of an application. Implementing Rules Engines that support 
                            configuration-based rules or that consolidate these rules into one place make it easier to change those rules when they are used in an application, 
                            and it also makes it easier to test those rules with Unit Tests as conditions can be checked and the outcome can still be an if statement on the resulting 
                            outcome of a Rules Engine.
                        </p>
                        <h3>How should you use a Rules Engine?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Rules Engines will usually follow similar patterns and at their heart is the Rule, which is a business policy, it is a set of Conditions that are applied 
                            where the outcome of these will either Pass or Fail. In the case of the Microsoft Rules Engine each Rule contains a C# Lambda Expression that can be executed 
                            on Input Data to product a Boolean output and for the Rule to Succeed the expression would need to return true. These expressions will act as the Conditions 
                            such as only allowing Users of a certain Age to be able to see something or some other criteria that can be expressed in a C# Lambda expression.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Microsoft's Rules Engine can support many Rules within a Workflow that can be executed allowing you to chain Rules together, once any input has been executed 
                            against a Workflow a Collection of RulesResultTree models will be returned. The collection of RuleResultTree models will contain the Rule and a value to say 
                            if it were successful or not and as a developer you can decide whether to proceed on any or all rules passing, which can be achieved by using an All or Any 
                            LINQ expression on the resulting output.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Who can use a Rules Engine?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Rules Engines such Microsoft Rules Engines can be used by developers to implement the workflows for an application in their code and then have the rules either 
                            be contained in one place if they need that to be part of the code or fully configurable with a JSON based configuration that can even define a workflow itself. 
                            This flexibility could allow for anyone to be able to configure the Rules and Conditions for an application without needing to change the application at all or 
                            if as part of the application without affecting the rest of the application. This is especially useful if your domain rules change on a regular basis, you may 
                            be responding to regulatory changes than means a rule needs to be implemented swiftly or you may just have something you want to be able to easily change in the 
                            future when requirements change.
                        </p>
