                    <h3>Day Two</h3>
                    <p>
                        We returned to the Business Design Centre for Day Two and restocked the stickers, pens and business cards out on display that many visitors to our stand the previous 
                        day had got from us ready to give out many more to those visitors who would be stopping by our stand on the second day! We also had many people stop by that Dawn knew 
                        including Nancy Baughen who organises Crimecon, Naomi Channell and so many others along with Steven Keogh who we'd invited to The Podcast Show, 
                        it was great to start Day Two to see so many familiar faces!

                    <p>
                        It was a bit quieter the second day but that didn't mean we still welcomed many more visitors to our stand! We had people from the show floor and front of house come to 
                        talk to us along with many new podcasters wanting help and existing podcasters wanting to see what we could offer and small businesses or freelancers seeing what they 
                        could offer! It was getting to the afternoon, and it was time for Dawn to do her very first talk on The Creator Stage hosted by Mary Neves from Spreaker, unfortunately 
                        her fellow participant Nules from Ireland Crimes & Mysteries didn't make it to the talk on time, so Dawn and Mary did the talk themselves, where Dawn spoke about her 
                        journey with Scottish Murders and how her victim-focused approach is important to her along with great responses from family members who wanted their stores out there 
                        as well as talking about those families who'd rather not have their family member's story out there. Dawn also covered how she is getting family members or those who 
                        knew victims more involved in the podcast, it was also great to hear great questions from the crowd which included how to better support guests who may need help 
                        after sharing their stores and more. It was great to see Dawn do her very first talk, but she did so well and no-one there would have realised it was her first time 
                        ever on stage! Mary from Spreaker did a great job supporting her and made sure to help her prepare and was definitely the highlight of not only the day but the whole 
                        event for both of us!

                    <h4>Traitor or Faithful: Uncloaking the Secrets Behind a Landmark Companion Podcast - Josh Adley, Harry Clark, 
                        Ed Gamble, Louise Katternhorn, Syeda Irtizaali & Darby Dorras</h4>
                    <p>
                        Harry, winner of series two of The Traitors in the UK, is riding the wave from being on The Traitors and relationships mended as they treated it like a show but did feel nervous seeing 
                        the clips from the final. The talkability of the show was critical and had a direct intimate engagement with a podcast. Was led by podcast 
                        sensibilities but looked like a television show. They had experimented with visualised podcasts before at BBC. Was integrated from the start 
                        and they wanted to do something different and included co funding and everyone wanted show to succeed and give experience of the show. 
                        Ed did it and would have done it anyway. Podcast format lends itself well to a show like The Traitors and the audience appreciates it.

                    <p>
                        Visualised Podcast is not same as television show but was controversial, but it is not constructed like a TV show at all. This had sensibilities 
                        of podcast but had some set dressing, it is a subtle difference though. It was a podcast team that worked on the show, it is a group chat like 
                        season one and that approach went through the show. The cameras make it look good and they used a podcast set, there was less space behind camera 
                        than in front of camera. Audience journey was BBC One, BBC Two and then BBC Sounds for bonus which carried on from the TV part and this content 
                        did better in Sounds as people were doing that journey. Audiences had a choice to listen to the whole thing in BBC Sounds. Things were adjusted 
                        as they went along. Ed loved the traitors and found took time to loosen up people and took time to chat through it and when got to bonus content 
                        they were more relaxed so that content was much better. The reveals worked well for the visualised podcast. Harry wasn't doing audio content, 
                        he wanted to say when he would get to the top of the list of people that Ed suspected but Ed didn't watch all of them but could have, but glad 
                        he didn't as would have kept saying, what about Harry?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the producers would let slip who was coming on next show. Harry felt nervous about being on last show full of people he murdered and 
                        betrayed and was like oh my gosh what is going on. They did last episode as-live before episode went out in a theatre - that wasn't planned 
                        as an as live finale but was for practical reasons and have moment of cast all together. The VTs of reveals is what audience wanted in season 
                        one, they kept things in bounds of castle and included when people left, became clear from engagement people were desperate to find out how 
                        people reacted to when they found out who the traitors are. Gave them access to the people as they left. Looks and feels like a friendly chat. 
                        Next series, there will be people playing a game but couldn't say anything else!

                        We weren't the only ones exhibiting at The Podcast Show there were dozens of other companies including Heil Sound who were our neighbours along with Spotify 
                        and Audio Technica but also many more I was able to photograph although I did realise I'd missed a couple including Choppity and Voiceworks but was great to 
                        see so many large and small businesses talking about the products and services they offer, many of which would come in handy for new or existing podcasters or 
                        even help other small businesses and freelancers!

                    <p>
                        The two days were over, we had so many visitors come by our stand to speak to us, the last person to stop by recognised the Scottish Murders podcast as being 
                        one his girlfriend listened to and knew a few others who listened to it as well, which was a great way to end the day! We began the teardown of our stand which 
                        didn't take as long putting it up and it wasn't long before we were done and ready to leave the Business Design Centre and The Podcast Show 2024, we caught a 
                        glimpse of our name on the billboard outside and headed back to the hotel! We were so well looked after during our time at The Podcast Show, with friendly and 
                        helpful staff including Tim who was in charge of Health and Safety who helped look after us and others there!

                    <p>
                        The following day we took one last look outside and made our way to London King's Cross Station to head back up to Newcastle, it was a very busy train due the 
                        Bank Holiday Weekend and we still had the stand rolled up and almost didn't have room for it but were lucky and managed to squeeze it in, before long we were 
                        almost back home and the journey was over! Overall, The Podcast Show was an amazing couple of days and a fantastic start for our new business, Cluarantonn, 
                        helping us realise that a friendly introduction to the world of podcasting was exactly what people needed, and something that will flourish from there and 
                        grow into something amazing in the future!
