                        AI & Copilot - Artificial Intelligence will significantly shape the way we work by automative routine tasks, augmenting human capabilities and drive 
                        more data driven decision making. This description was generated by AI when asked to explain itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        AI timeline was in 1956 when artificial intelligence was first coined by Alan Turing and 1997 was when Machine Learning for machines to learn and 2018 
                        for Deep learning followed by 2019 for developments in generative AI.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        OpenAI + Microsoft - Microsoft own 49% and supplement their products with it, to help with things like coding things or getting help with images. You 
                        can get text, conversation, code and images with AI and in the near future will be speech which sounds like talking to a human. Prompting is something 
                        you give AI to get a response, and the AI understands conversationally what was said in a previous response.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Microsoft 365 Copilot - built on Microsoft's comprehensive approach including Security, Compliance, Privacy and Responsible AI. When using AI there is 
                        a whole set of governance that comes with using models. Microsoft 365 apps have Copilot built in including Word, Excel, PowerPoint to provide 
                        assistance to users such as drafting content which can be regenerated where needed and edited before being used plus other things such as meeting 
                        summaries, responses to emails and more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Microsoft Teams with Copilot can help with instant meeting effectiveness and be more present in a meeting. As you get into Teams can kick off a 
                        transcription, which is based on what everyone said, if you're late to a meeting can get a summary of what was said or can generate meeting notes 
                        and shows all the main points and any action items at the end and even understands a North East of England accent. Copilot in Teams can also see 
                        what questions were raised and can see the context of where it got the information from in the transcript and can see who spoke and who talked the 
                        most. You can see who were engaged and can go over previous meetings and see who attended and what each person talked about and get a recap to know 
                        what happened in the last meeting and where you are at.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can put information into a table using Copilot in Word and you can also stay on top of long email threads and response quickly. You get a long 
                        email thread, and you want to know what it was all about, with Copilot it can summarise this and even write a response or say thank you to someone 
                        and there are different options for tone including short, medium and long responses. It will use the same kind of language you use in your emails 
                        and when happy with it you can keep it and send. Copilot is there to create content not to do it for you, it is up to you to read and check it before 
                        you send it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Copilot can create a rapid business case in Word which can even use information from the web to supplement content. Copilot can understand a prompt 
                        about what a business case is from the web and looks at documents from your organisation. You don't have to just look at a blank piece of paper but 
                        get Copilot to start and write most of it and you can feed documents into it as a source in order to write a response to it. It is like having your 
                        own PA built into your PC all the time. The most expensive thing you can buy is time, how can you be more present in a meeting and the answer is 
                        Copilot, it is built in, when using ChatGPT any data is being used to train the model but with Copilot it is staying in the boundaries of your tenant. 
                        Copilot for Microsoft 365 is around £24.70 per month as of August 2024.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Microsoft Dynamics 365 has a contact centre and as on a phone call it is transcribing the conversation and providing some of the responses you can do 
                        using AI and can be passed onto an agent where needed which can state which answers are appropriate and can link into Teams to bring in people who are 
                        appropriate to answer a question.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you are saying please and thank you, you seemingly get better responses, but it is based on algorithms, so it is showing what the next appropriate 
                        response is which is how large language models work. Anything you say to Copilot stays within the model and does not get used to train the model and 
                        you can get any output to be as needed such as British English rather than American English and you can even use Copilot with Microsoft apps on Mac. 
                        AI can be used for taking notes too or generate a presentation from a Word document in PowerPoint so could then spend less time and within an hour 
                        after tweaking images got the results you wanted rather than take a couple of days to put together the presentation. Microsoft is seeing savings 
                        with support tickets by generating appropriate responses using Copilot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Human touch is still important, and Copilot is being used to enhance things, but could it do your work for you or say it could? Who knows where things 
                        will be going and how often has each technology been stated to lose jobs but instead created new jobs, but Copilot helps and augments humans, but most 
                        organisations aren't generally losing staff but helping their staff achieve more with AI and be more productive and see more returns as then companies 
                        are quite happy with this situation. Companies can look how to be more creative with AI and you can even get prompts generated by AI to use with 
                        another AI to get information you wanted. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When using AI to do a performance appraisal but if is doesn't produce the results you need as can always change words or remove things that don't make 
                        sense or sound right then can move things or change things but can still be structured well and remove words you wouldn't use, you want the content to 
                        be a reflection of yourself and how you would write things. You have to be happy with how things are presented and rather than spending hours on 
                        something and would be better to use Copilot to do that instead it makes sense so can focus on other things and if you don't use it then you're 
                        spending time doing things it could help with and it is that, that doesn't make sense.

                    <h4>Founder, G2 Solutions & Intelligence Fusion - Michael McCabe</h4>
                    <p>
                        Michael talked about their journey taking a business from startup to successful exit. Their background is they were born in the 80s and in school 
                        they filled in a survey about what jobs they could do, and it was fence erector. They went to University in Liverpool and joined the British Army 
                        and then afterwards worked in the private sector in Iraq and were writing intelligence documents in Word but there was a demand for the data, and 
                        they came up with idea to deliver this data to clients in real-time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They wanted to setup their own business in the North East and asked, if they should do it and didn't have an MBA or exposure to business but at the 
                        time they did a consultancy business. Their idea wasn't refined down but they bought a book Set up a Successful Small Business to know how to learn 
                        to start a business.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They found guidance by doing networking and to the BNI and got help refining the idea and helped raise some money to build the MVP of their platform 
                        using £22,500 of funding. MVP creation using Ambix as a foundation which they used for their requirements, but Ambix owned the IP but was a good way 
                        of getting the product out there, They were trying to get a global intelligence feed out there but did a internship with Durham University with around 
                        fourty interns from there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They created their product by using the book LEAN Startup by Eric Ries and also got more funding of around £478,000 but had to pick certain key 
                        elements to work on as couldn't do everything at once but this allowed them to build their own platform which was build for them and they owned the 
                        IP this time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They got traction from marketing with visual based analysis which was shared on LinkedIn and are always very visual with their marketing and are B2B, 
                        so this was the best avenue as other social media is B2C. Their first customers included Booking.com and Spotify but their revenue was choppy with 
                        good periods and bad periods. Through this they found their market fit with intelligence with the depth and breadth of information along with accuracy 
                        as their platform was the most accurate on the market. They also had ICPs which helped with sales and marketing, and they had focus on customer 
                        acquisition and retention as it is hard to get them so want to keep them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Scaleup was achieved with more investment including more analysts for that global feed of intelligence and started to do more LinkedIn adverts 
                        spending around £5,000 per month and would get twelve product demos a month that way. They also built a new website for lead generation and refined 
                        their marketing campaigns with more video content and attending consistent events and picked up an eight-year contract with ExxonMobil to develop 
                        their own custom intelligence platform.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Covid then happened and conversations stopped for at least a month and oil prices dropped and the platform with oil and gas wasn't successful at all. 
                        They also took matched loans and resulted in a different business environment with more public sector clients.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Exiting was six potential acquirers and ended up selling to Sigma7 who were a startup intelligence company, and they got 9.4x their annual revenue and 
                        how much they would pay was how much it is worth to them, and they sold it for £7,000,000 which was how much their investors were willing to take. It 
                        was a hard, draining process with need to have an in-depth understanding of company and you still need to run the business. and it takes around six 
                        months, and the founder is expected to stay with some equity in the Sigma7.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When your business is acquired, it is not your business anymore, when you sell you sell. Although they have left the company, they do still do 
                        contracting for them but when self-employed you create and drive your own vision to your own standards with the culture you want to work in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Biggest lessons are having more investment in the North East of England and the government needs to invest more but this will only get you so far. 
                        You need to get the right people around you such as operations, technology, marketing and sales and if make a hiring mistake then fix it quickly. 
                        Also join organisations like Dynamo and make doing business fun. If you are a tech business, you should be able to sell it with a wireframe diagram. 
                        There's hard work needed as when in sales you need to pick up the phone and put in the effort as it will pay off. You need to plan for your exit by 
                        liking at what your company needs to look like to sell it including revenue level, client base and structure and maturity of the business. For 
                        equity is don't give too much away too soon because may get to the point where the equity left doesn't feel worth it, need to balance equity with 
                        capital to grow and exit.

                        If you know your sector inside and out, they make the best salespeople, you have to take an interest in the client to craft a solution around them. 
                        Better to take on analysts and teach them sales and give them the tools they need to sell better. Selling to intelligence analysts is easier if you 
                        are an intelligence analyst.

                    <h4>Founder & Business Change Consultant, Fettle IT - Helen Doherty</h4>
                    <p>
                        Helen helps companies deliver change and their experience is delivering change in many companies, primalily IT focused for a range of industries and 
                        companies working on software delivery at at <a href="https://www.fettle-it.com/" target="_blank">Fettle IT</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Why are businesses bad at change? Change is hard due to risk and upheaval and changes you don't what to do or are behind the times and don't want to 
                        be found out or there's new legislation and have to do more compliance changes or maybe you'll lose your job or department. People don't get to get 
                        good at change as they don't do it very often.
                    </p>                    
                    <p>
                        Big mistakes are inexperience and not fixing the right problem - solutionising and by treating the symptom and not the right cause or not knowing what 
                        good looks like. They have seen solutions to make someone read a newsletter with an expensive solution but the content itself was wrong or boring and 
                        were looking at the wrong end of the problem. Not treating it like a project and trying to see things work by magic. Planning in a vacuum or in secret 
                        and businesses throwing a change grenade over a fence. Unrealistic expectations are common including unrealistic and challenging deadlines for 
                        something to be done end-to-end and deliver something in a arbitrarily short deadline.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wishful outsourcing is buying something to solve your problems and will magically deliver your needs, but vendors can only sell what they have, they
                         don't work for you if they are not building bespoke software. They won't tell you that an existing system can be used more efficiently and effectively 
                         and won't recommend a better fit from a competitor. Vendors have their own objectives they don't have to live with the solution, if they give you 
                         something that isn't that great what can they do and won't let you customise it beyond a certain point and businesses can get tied in and if they 
                         aren't great you have to live with it and may be stuck with what you have chosen - the sunk cost fallacy.

                    <p>
                        Business impacts can be change is delayed or stalled, rework or additional spend is required if didn't solve the underlying problem and there's time 
                        and effort wasted. If throwing a lot of chaotic change this can have an effect on morale plus there can be loss of confidence, goodwill and customer 
                        satisfaction. If you're competitors are doing change better and faster your customers will go there instead.

                        your competitor and businesses always want to do massive changes planned years in the future but instead plan a step and do it and keep doing this 
                        one step at a time. If staff are seeing you are doing things right and asking the right questions they will naturally be engaged.

                    <h3>In Conversation With...</h3>
                    <h4>O.agency - Rachel Hodgson speaking to CO-Founder & COO, Haystack - Mike Davies</h4>
                    <p>
                        Mike is one of the co-founders of <a href="https://www.haystackapp.io/" target="_blank">Haystack</a>, they used to be a software engineer, but 
                        they don't do so much coding anymore but spends time running the business instead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rachel asked what is Haystack all about? It is a bit of a disrupter for the recruitment space, they are a tech hiring space who connect people writing 
                        code and connecting them with tech employers and for those growing their teams just starting out or existing large companies recruiting many people 
                        or for a diverse hiring.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rachel asked how did they see the gap in the market with Haystack? They did computer science at Newcastle University and did things deliberately to 
                        know how to build a tech product and at university they got hired to build the app as were looking for someone who knew how to write code and build 
                        mobile apps and it still gets used now and was their first experience building a product used by many people. After university they joined a startup, 
                        Hive, was to find coolest B2B SAAS company at the time and after six months grew company and teams and the product, at every stage of the journey 
                        there was a pain point which including hiring software engineers. They though how can't people like them find a company like Hive. Employers when 
                        they raise investment and take on a contract, they need more staff so turn to a recruitment agency and for software engineers it is hard to find a 
                        job and need to use recruiters or job boards which are all exactly the same with little or no context and with LinkedIn you're bombarded with texts 
                        and spam.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rachel asked if lack of transparency with recruiters an issue? Haystack gives you context as it gives that information like Rightmove when looking at the 
                        property you want people use Haystack in the same way to look for a new job but people also use their app in the same way to passively use it as a 
                        research tool and have full control in their hands and seems they are on to something and have over 100,000 candidates on their system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rachel then asked who is the dream client they have won? They did somehow with American Express, these opportunities land on your desk sometimes such 
                        as them and Lloyds Bank and Raytheon along with big employers such as Amazon and Meta.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rachel then asked what was the biggest learning curve? Do you just build a product and people will come to you, well no but they joined Ignite 
                        program and tried to meet as many people as possible and networking events are like a lottery and you don't know who you may meet, and they found 
                        Dan who co-founded Bede Gaming who came on board and accelerated the business. They were in that frame of writing code but how to you roll it out 
                        but as business grows you try to work it out as you go along.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rachel then asked does people having more than surface level knowledge important? You have to be able to know how to sell a product and cohesively 
                        understand the product to explain it to an audience. Apple reframed the iPod was a million songs in your pocket rather than 1Gb of storage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rachel then asked How do you hand things over and does it become easier? Four years later it is even harder it never gets easier, but the sales side 
                        is getting people in who want to learn and thrive in a startup environment and how do you take things in their and co-founder head and deliver that 
                        to their employees and look at how do you scale your sales people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rachel asked were things looking like they are going in in the right direction? They have to worry about tech candidates and businesses and built out 
                        the former first but as soon as they landed on a few thousand they weren't charging initially so now they have something that works and can put a 
                        price tag on it. The B2C is to see if people are using the product as it is intended to be used and reaching that end goal to get a job.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rachel asked what was surprising aspect of business? Covid was a surprise, and they hired their first employee the first day of lockdown and had got 
                        £400,000 investment but was a nightmare to build a team remotely and how to build a startup culture when working from home. They managed to ride wave 
                        of using software, but a lot of tech companies had over hired for roles, but things have settled down. Employers get a lot of irrelevant applications 
                        so how do you reduce that and how do you make them more appealing on Haystack.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rachel asked if they have any mentors or advice? They have lots of mentors, you can't do it yourself and have to be good at delegating, you may be 
                        invested more but need to figure out the customer success piece for example but may not be the best at that and need to delegate and look for best 
                        person. For sales they were good, but they couldn't dedicate 100% of their attention so they needed to delegate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally Rachel asked for the next five years what is the plan for Haystack? When investors invest, they want to see an exit and a return, but they are on 
                        to something and could expand beyond the UK but will still focus on tech but new markets are next expansion and look at more later on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Audience questions included what challenges are there? Haystack doesn't exist without the candidates and to build a platform loved by tech people was 
                        important but for marketing is they have built a community liked by tech community so don't spend anything on acquiring candidates and rely on word on 
                        mouth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What Haystack offer compared to recruiter? Employers tap into candidates directly and don't have to pay recruitment fees. They are also used to hire 
                        more diverse tech talent and challenges are different on a customer-by-customer basis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How to do marketing to keep growing? The market can be a surplus of candidates which is at the moment or if a surplus of jobs means they may do 
                        advertising, do app store optimisation and offer a referral scheme to have tools in their toolbox to pull on so could spin up adverts if needed but 
                        have different growth levers they could turn on when needed. Haystack have found passive candidates who are happy in their current role are the most 
                        valuable candidates as if get those who are casually browsing is where you can find those gems who are sort of happy but something that lands in 
                        their lap that may interest them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How are they challenging goals for creating tech developers? There are a lot of entry level candidates and Haystack work with company like Tech 
                        Returners to get people back into tech companies and work with North Coders to take entry level students and get entry level talent. Entry level
                         jobs can be posted on Haystack for free and is a genuine challenge they have been wrestling with for many years. They often encourage companies 
                         to look internally and train them up for tech roles within a company, they are the marketplace to find opportunities but work with organisations 
                         such as Treehouse which have really good training initiatives for people from a different department who really wants to learn how to code and 
                         train them up into those positions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Do they have anything for developing countries to insource capabilities? Haystack would like to look at new markets and place a lot of people on 
                        visa sponsorships but is something they would be interested in looking more into in the future.
                    </p>
