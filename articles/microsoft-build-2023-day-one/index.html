                    <h3>Microsoft Build Opening - Satya Nadella</h3>
                    <p>
                        Welcome to Build! Satya Nadella said at the Opening of Microsoft Build! It is fantastic to be
                        back together and everyone joining online especially platform shifts are in the air. It is
                        exciting to come to Microsoft
                        Build 2023 to see that something big is shifting for developers. When Satya used older versions
                        of GPT which is the pursuit of the dream machine which started from a paper in
                        1945 with “As We May Think” and continyes through to PCs, the world wide web and today to Chat
                        GPT. <i>Computers are bicycles for the mind - Steve Jobs.</i>
                        Recently is seems we went from the bicycle to the steam engine.
                    </p>
                    <h4>How we build</h4>
                    <p>
                        How do we build is fundamentally changing, codespaces allowed developers to create an
                        environment to be created is seconds or dev box allows you to create an environment in less
                        than an hour or GitHub Copilot to help assist developers and GitHub Actions allows you to say in
                        the command line or stay in the development environment. Stay on task and stay in
                        the flow of programming. How we build software is radically different.
                    </p>
                    <h4>What we build</h4>
                    <p>
                        This will be the story of Microsoft Build. Every week there is something new, Microsoft are
                        infusing AI across all layers starting with Copilot with GitHub then adding this to other
                        products such as Microsoft 365 or with the Copilot for Bing and Edge and the AI infrastructure
                        itself with OpenAI, every layer of the stack is profoundly changing.
                    </p>

                        ChatGPT - Bringing Bing to ChatGPT - ChatGPT is the fastest growing consumer feature and is
                        available now to GPT+ and will be available to the free tier.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Windows Copilot - Bringing Copilot to the biggest canvas of all, Windows and make every user of
                        Windows a Power user, it will be fully integrated into Windows 11 and can do
                        things such as recommend a playlist from Spotify, simplify workflows within Windows and get more
                        done and access all of Microsoft with Windows Copilot.

                        Copilot Stack - Apps with plugin extensibility which will allow people to build their own
                        applications with Copilots and have common extensibility across all these services
                        such as ChatGPT, Bing Chat, Microsoft Copilots and Windows Copilots and bring this to billions
                        of users.

                    <p>
                        Copilots & Plugins - Microsoft are fast delivering on their vision of bringing copilot features
                        to the web which includes integrating Bing into ChatGTP and allows for up-to-date
                        content with citations sourced by Bing. Microsoft will bring interoperability between plugins
                        for ChatGPT and Microsoft Bing so can use the same plugins in both. Adding value to
                        the plugins by allowing them to work across the entire web in Edge and surface those plugins
                        there and deliver incredible productivity features for people. Within Microsoft Word
                        you can use plug ins with the Microsoft 365 Copilot which can include document intelligence to
                        see changes in an easy-to-use way and create documents in a more powerful way.
                        Within Microsoft Teams you could use the Jira plugin with Microsoft 365 Copilot and create tasks
                        and keep you in your flow. Windows Copilot will change how you use your PC forever,
                        you can invoke it from the task bar and show a side pane where you can ask questions with great
                        suggestions which you can put into action with one click such as how to switch to dark
                        mode or use the plugin from Spotify to get a great playlist and can even organise your windows
                        with a natural language request. They already have over fifty plugins and are looking
                        forward to what developers can built that will integrate with these AI Copilots and provide
                        developers opportunities to reach more users.

                    <p>
                        These are just five of the fifty announcements that are coming in Microsoft Build. How to build
                        these next generation of applications and build them with safety first. Pursuit
                        of GDP growth with increase of this based on technology revolutions such as the printing press,
                        mass production, information technology through to the development of AI.
                        We want the standard of living to go up, that is why we do what we do. Things that we build can
                        in fact make a different to the whole world, not just a small group of people
                        with diffusion that takes days and weeks not years and centuries. We do this in such a way that
                        we manage the energy transition and need to empower every person on the planet
                        to achieve more. What we do in the next weeks and months will have a profound impact on eight
                        billion people.

                    <h3>The era of the AI Copilot - Kevin Scott</h3>
                    <p>
                        A lot has changed over the past four years, but even more has changed over the past year.
                        Wanting to do things that you didn't know were possible, how to make something that was
                        impossible, possible. The power of AI is doing to help to do this and make something possible
                        that was impossible and do something great with it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What's happening with the rapid progress of AI models and innovation of OpenAI in partnership
                        with Microsoft and are setting the pace of change. Microsoft have most powerful super
                        computers, most capable foundation models from open-source and have the worlds' best AI
                        infrastructure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Azure is the cloud for AI and is the beginning of this end-to-end infrastructure for AI, which
                        is allowing Microsoft to deliver their AI solutions along with those using Azure.
                        Windows is the best client for AI developers.

                    <p>
                        Copilot - an application using modern AI to assist you with complex cognitive tasks and
                        Microsoft are opening up their platform to allow developers to create their own Copilots.
                    </p>
                    <h4>OpenAI</h4>
                    <p>
                        Building GPT and ChatGPT which is probably the most interesting Copilot in the world right now.
                        ChatGPT adoption has been huge and the challenge to build it was immense. OpenAI
                        had an idea of a chat system for years, but the moment that when it clicked was GPT-4 and the
                        training they did meant it could follow instructions and have a conversation and
                        had the infrastructure for the earlier models and wasn't designed for chat, but it wanted to
                        chat. CPT-4 was a labour of love and they went back to the drawing board and rebuild
                        the infrastructure, they wanted all the features and details to work correctly. It is sometimes
                        the boring engineering work that often leads to success.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The idea to empower developers to write software to extend the capabilities of ChatGPT and the
                        Copilots Microsoft are building but don't have all the technical issues sorted out yet.
                        Plugins are an amazing opportunity to leverage this technology and make it better for everyone
                        with an Open Standard with a core principle to allow developers to bring the power from
                        any domain is exciting. If you understand the core concepts you can bring something together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What is over the horizon, we're almost on a tick tock cycle where you come up with an innovation
                        and really push it with features they are still productionising and are able to
                        reduce costs with new models as things change in the future, what's expensive today won't be
                        tomorrow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this field the technology is clearly getting better and better but what developers can do is
                        figure out how to make this work in their domain, understand what pain points there
                        are to adopt this kind of technology, developers are the people who will make AI great.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Copilot</h4>
                    <p>
                        When Microsoft when building copilots they realised that the idea of them is pretty universal
                        and applies to more things that just software development like GitHub Copilot.
                        Microsoft needed to find out what was common across all these things and look at what stack
                        would be needed to deliver these easily and safely, they have been able to develop
                        these by building a stack that would allow them to move quickly with safety.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A platform is when the economic value of everybody that uses it exceeds the value of the company
                        that creates it. Then it's a platform” - Bill Gates
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Gives developers the chance to create things with something that otherwise wouldn't exist.
                        Prevent people from baring the burden of building things from the ground-up, but build
                        only the things they need to build. Foundation models are reusable and generalisable and make
                        sure this was a durable property of these systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Copilot + Plugins - Foundational models can't do everything. You should have ways to accommodate
                        your application to build it on top of this technology even if that is not
                        complete or perfect. Augment an AI application or Copilot to do more to access APIs, retrieve
                        useful information, perform new computations and safely act on the user's behalf.
                        Plugins are actuators for the digital world to attach those things to Copilots.
                    </p>

                        Reimage software development with AI - user experience, application architecture but with safety
                        and security that needs to be thought about. What doesn't change is you must build
                        a great product, you have to understand what that unmet user need is, what your unique
                        understanding of this is, then you need to apply the technology but need to still think about
                        what good product making is. The model is not your product, this is just infrastructure enabling
                        your product, don't fixate on infrastructure you need to focus on the product, don't
                        build infrastructure you don't have to build. It's up to you to create great experiences.

                        Copilot Stack contains the Front End which is the plugin extensibility and User Experience.
                        Orchestration with prompt response filtering and meta prompt with grounding and plugin execution.
                        User Experience is to understand what the machine is capable of and how to express the
                        connection between the human and machine, to fully anticipate the needs of the user and architect
                        this in a familiar way, but you will spend less time on this as they have a natural mechanism to
                        do this is natural language. You just need to think about what it needs to do that the
                        model cannot do, but less of this mapping around of User Interface elements to code, and need to
                        think about what you want the Copilot not to do, you need to restrain it to your domain,
                        need to keep something on task. Orchestration is like the business logic of your Copilot and can
                        decide to have one with Semantic Kernel which is common way of doing this as there is a
                        lot of commonalities but there are also other examples that work well with Azure infrastructure.
                        The fundamental thing you are going to be manipulating will be a bunch of tokens, such
                        as a question or something an application constructs, a big part of this is response and prompt
                        filtering if they don't meet the needs of the user but may have other reasons to do
                        filtering on them. Metaprompt is what is sent in every conversation, this is where the safety
                        tuning occurs and what personality to use such as in Bing Chat to be more balanced or
                        more precise so is a form of fine tuning. Once you get past this you have Grounding where you
                        can add additional context such as retrieval augmented generation, where look at a
                        prompt and then add extra context to provide a better response. You could have a Vector database
                        to return documents or information for a response. Plugin may give extra context
                        in grounding or may do some plugin execution when going back up from the model. You may be doing
                        multiple passes to get what you need from the system. Foundation models and
                        finetuning of them can be used or you can bring your own models. There will be a marketplace of
                        models you can use in your Copilots and you could even train your model from scratch.

                        Kevin Scott has a podcast Behind the Tech but doesn't like write social media posts so wrote a
                        Copilot that would create the posts. It runs on a Windows PC using mixture of
                        open-source and hosted models and calls a plugin to do its work. The first thing it does is use
                        Whisper model to get a transcript from the episode, then the next stage uses
                        Dolly 2.0 to get information from the transcript such as the name of the guest and then use Bing
                        Search API to get the bio for the guest and combine this together as a packet
                        of information, then use the Azure OpenAI service to get an image from the DALL-E model then
                        invoke a plugin for LinkedIn which will take the information and post this,
                        but before it takes an action on the user's behalf by giving an option to review this. <a

                    <p>
                        .NET is a complete solution for building modern web applications for front-end and back-end with
                        everything you need right out of the box. Some of the largest services in
                        the world are powered by .NET such as Microsoft Teams is using .NET 6 and gained better latency
                        and doubled efficiency. Bing upgraded their high-performance workflow engine
                        (XAP) to .NET 7 and saw dramatic improvements in performance. You can build applications from
                        the front end to the back end.
                    </p>
                    <h4>The best of server & client with Blazor in .NET 8</h4>
                    <p>
                        You can have applications that serve contents for
                        requests such as MVC and Razor Pages from ASP.NET with server-side rendering (SSR)
                        and can use Blazor for client-side rendering (CSR). With Blazor's component model you can create
                        elements that and be used for front-end or back-end. In .NET 8 you can do full
                        server-side rendering with Blazor, you can have a routable component that can be rendered from a
                        request to it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With Blazor you can do validation and rendering of elements server side and have elements be
                        navigated to and if you use Blazor united you can have server-side rendering
                        where Blazor can update pages and intercept the request and update the DOM but is still doing
                        full server-side rendering. If you need to do an API call this may delay the
                        rendering of the page so you can improve this with streaming rendering where you can have
                        placeholder content and have updates on the same connection if enable streaming
                        rendering and when this data has been obtained the page will be seamlessly updated, this is
                        still rendered on the server and getting pixels on the screen as quickly as
                        possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you want to add some more interactivity to a page such as being able to see a preview of a
                        picture that is being uploaded. You can apply component render modes which can be server based
                        and enable some interactive logic. You can get islands of web server interactivity in an
                        application, and this can be freed up when no longer used. You can also change the component render mode for
                        WebAssembly and for a particular page you could have thedotnet.wasm downloaded on a per page and
                        per component level and this is then cached which can be used later. You can start users on web
                        server then download the donet.wasm in the background and the application can use this by setting the
                        render mode of the component to auto so can then decide on the render mode at runtime, when it
                        is loaded the first time it will use the server-side one but once reload it will see the .NET
                        WebAssembly runtime has been downloaded and will use this.

                        handling where can take contents of form and post these to a minimal API but for file uploads
                        these can be used along with problem details service which is a standard way of returning errors
                        from a REST endpoint there is also the additional of a API explorer and you can test your API
                        endpoints within Visual Studio and helpful analysers that tells you that you are making a
                        mistake with a minimal API.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You could build a backend with a minimal API and a frontend with JavaScript and you can expose endpoints such as 
                        MapGroup where you can provide multiple grouped endpoints and you can see different parts of a route better with 
                        improved syntax highlighting and you get code completion to see what constraints are available and routes are not 
                        just a string but can be interacted with programmatically and you can have objects used that you then get informed 
                        of a need to TryParse those values. You can find endpoints more easily with the endpoint explorer and can navigate 
                        to the place in the code they are defined, and you can even generate a request and create a “http” file to interact 
                        with an API and see what it is doing.

                        Servers and middleware features include request timeouts so can define a policy that will issue a cancellation token 
                        you can deal with, there is also short-circuit middleware where you can short-circuit a response directly out. HTTP 3 
                        is now supported by default and named pipes are supported which is a means of communication between windows so you can 
                        have interop between applications you have written. Authentication and authorisation improvements especially in the area 
                        of enhancements for Single Player Applications including client-friendly endpoints for identity management, support for 
                        tokens in self-host scenarios (without OIDC server) remove IdentityServer from templates (option for OIDC) and simplified 
                        custom policies with IAuthorizationRequirementData. You have the identity manager which are some APIs you interact with 
                        to manage an identity along with an Identity Store and have added Endpoints so the Client UI can interact with these.

                    <p>
                        You can check out the C# documentation which has a what's new in C# 12 section which will be filled out as features are announced 
                        before it launches in November. Most updates to the language have been removing boilerplate.
                    </p>

                        Something that wasn't fleshed out since C# 1.0 when doing static usings you can use a keyword type without having to spell it out, you 
                        can also use other syntactic constructs such as tuple syntax with named tuples.  You could use Pointers, but these must be used in an 
                        unsafe context so can add unsafe to be able to use this in the using.
                    </p>

                        There is something that Records have that Classes don't have which is primary constructors which would automatically show up as properties, 
                        but this isn't what you want to do this with a class on whether you want to expose these, so you can use primary constructors in classes but 
                        these don't autogenerate exposed properties but you can use them as parameters throughout the instance members of the class, these values are 
                        captured into something after the enclosing things have occurred and will be in scope in these other places, they would be captured as parameters 
                        assigned to members if you implemented this yourself. When you chain constructors, you must always get to the primary constructor and the primary 
                        constructor then calls base so would work as expected, this had to be less of a feature than it is for records, but this was harder to design than 
                        it was for records. Primary constructors would have been added in C# 6 but there was a choice between that and interpolated strings which were 
                        added instead.

                        When creating new lists can be hard as arrays have an empty for those but you can initialise a list with a collection literal with square brackets around 
                        the items and the target type is inferred and you can use [] for an empty list as a collection literal which can also be used with Arrays. Pattern matching 
                        also supports this same syntax already for using square brackets for the way objects are created and the way they are consumed in a pattern but have started 
                        with a pattern and put this into the syntax for a collection. You can also use .. when defining lists and merge something into a collection literal and where 
                        it is the same syntax to get this out with a pattern match. Being able to assign collection literals to var is still something that is being figured out. 
                        What about a Dictionary being assigned to with a collection literal by using a colon but this is still in active development and is as yet undecided.

                        It is more common for features to be added in stages to C#, something that it is high value and then see how it is used and then feature more addons to the 
                        language for example lambda expressions didn't have a natural type but this was eventually added, if something isn't there yet it can be added in the next 
                        or a future release. Pattern matching was made as efficient as it possibly could and can be more efficient than something you would write yourself and the 
                        collection literals when they have a target type will be the most efficient way of creating them so these shouldn't be something you don't use because of 
                        performance reasons.

                        Extension methods were introduced in C# 3, and these are amazing and been a very big hit and allow code to be layered differently and can have other domains 
                        that augment a class without changing the original class, but you can only do this is instance methods but have been trying to extend this with other methods. 
                        You could declare an explicit extension for an object and then add methods to perform functionality, so this is like a transparent wrapper, this is something 
                        you do with something specific with and could have different methods that do something different such as parse as XML and parse as JSON. So can thinly wrap values 
                        with this “extension” and extend it with extra things. You could also have an implicit extension where all objects will have the extra members you could have 
                        extension methods, you can have extension everything, you don't need to wrap a new thing on the old thing, but it is the same object underneath. The real power 
                        of this is you can dot into it and see the intellisense and has discoverability. You could also allow something to implement an interface such as IParseable, 
                        the underlying object doesn't need to know this exists. This is the thinking around Extensions and it hasn't been fully decided how to implement this but can 
                        have the expressive power to do the separation of concerns and layering of software to give the next breakthrough in software composition.
