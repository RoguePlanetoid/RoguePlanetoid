                    <p>
                        Yesterday it was <a href="https://www.scottishsummit.com/" target="_blank">Scottish Summit</a>, which this year was on tour as it was held down in Manchester at
                        <a href="https://ua92.ac.uk/" target="_blank">UA92</a> I had submitted a talk for the conference but unfortunately it was not
                        selected, however they did have an option to have the talk appear on YouTube the week before so it
                        was possible to view <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScKslAgCZQE" target="_blank">How Sharing Can Make You a Better Developer</a> there instead! This also had the benefit of freeing me
                        to see another session I wouldn't have been able to so that was a positive way at looking at it! I
                        made my plans to go which included going by train and staying overnight as it wasn't possible to get
                        there in time from Gateshead in the North East to head South to the other North of Manchester.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thanks to <a href="https://bedegaming.com/">Bede</a> they were able to cover my travel and accommodation, which
                        they were happy to do after I'd booked everything but was really great to have that covered
                        especially as had actually travelled up to Scotland for something else that week, so I really
                        appreciated saving the expense of travelling to Scottish Summit! I started my journey by heading by
                        Taxi from Gateshead to Newcastle Central Station for my train which I discovered went direct to
                        Manchester, I'd not realised there were two main stations and I had booked to go to the other one
                        and thought I'd have to change, I had a good knowledge of railways both further North of there to
                        Scotland and further South to London but not Manchester it seems, but it did mean I could stay on
                        the train.

                        My train from Newcastle arrived in Manchester and because I didn't need to change I arrived there a bit earlier
                        than I had planned which was great, and upon arriving I headed for the Trams, I had downloaded the
                        app for them so knew where they were but the platforms were lettered not numbered so was a bit
                        confusing to find the one that would head to Cornbrook where I would change to Salford Quays but I
                        spotted it and boarded with just seconds to spare before it headed off! It was amazing to see
                        Manchester as I hadn't been there for years, I could see right away as I looked out the window of
                        the Tram the level of investment in the area was immense, something that has only started to happen
                        back further north in Newcastle / Gateshead! I arrived at the first stop to change to my next Tram,
                        I found there were not many signs or maps but I had downloaded the app so it wasn't too bad as could
                        use that, guess those living there are used to doing that too, I eventually boarded my tram to
                        Salford Quays to head to my hotel for the night.

                        I arrived in Salford Quays and was amazing to see the canals and vast areas of open water alongside
                        the Manchester Ship Canal and headed to my hotel to check in and then ventured out to have a small
                        walk around the area outside of the hotel before going next door and getting something to eat. After
                        that I decided to head for MediaCity UK as I had heard of that being there and wanted to check it
                        out, I was not disappointed! It was amazing to see the bridges on the way as they reminded me of the
                        bridges over the Tyne back home, I saw the ITV studios where the soap Coronation Street is filmed
                        and could see the flat backs of the façade of part of the set along with taller parts that could be
                        seen from the canal. I also saw the BBC buildings on the other side of the canal and had a good look
                        around the area, I was very impressed with what I saw, and the area was of course served by the
                        Trams, and headed back to the hotel after having a good look around MediaCity UK and Salford Quays.
                        However, that evening there would be some bad news, it seemed there was some overhead line issues in
                        one of the areas I had passed just a few hours earlier on the way to Manchester and resulted in my
                        train being cancelled, although the issue itself was resolved it remained cancelled so alternative
                        plans were made to head back home on a bus instead!

                        Next morning after planning what sessions I was going to I headed next door to the hotel for
                        breakfast and then headed back to the Tram as it was raining to head for Cornbrook and then to
                        change to Old Trafford. I got off there and saw the cricket ground right next door and the football
                        ground in the distance but in-between was the venue itself of UA92 and headed inside to pick up my
                        badge and then looked around and spoke to some of the sponsors there before heading to my first
                        session of the day, I wrote about all the sessions in my other article about Scottish Summit 2023
                        (link). It was great to see all the sessions and even changed one when one of the sponsors told me
                        more about it, it was so popular in the end many including myself had to sit on the floor, every
                        session was great with some sadly seeming too short and wanted to hear more with others being very
                        informative along with helping with putting together my own talks in future!

                        In the afternoon there was a football game going on that day at the stadium nearby and saw many
                        crowds, so it was good that were not going be caught up that as the game would be finished well
                        before the event would be! I had spoken to the sponsors that were downstairs but had missed the ones
                        on the first floor so had a chance to speak to them and there was a competition to win a LEGO Grogu / Baby Yoda,
                        which of course I entered! It was just before the last session of the day when the winner would be
                        chosen so I went along and a few others who had entered joined me, the draw happened very quickly
                        with the winner being selected, although I didn't win myself. After the prize draw I decided to head
                        down stairs and bumped into one of my fellow prize draw entrants and they mentioned that there was
                        also a cricket match going on that day too, and indeed looking outside started to see crowds heading
                        for the Trams, I realised I might not make my bus home so had to head off and miss the last session,
                        but I made it to the Tram stop but saw hundreds of people starting to queue up where I had just went
                        through, so I had made the right choice and got on the tram to head for Shudehill where I would be
                        getting my bus later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before heading for my bus, I went into the Trafford Centre to get something to eat, it was very busy
                        being a Saturday and had to wait a while to get my food, the extra time I gained from leaving early
                        meant I was able to do that, if not I'd have had to head for the bus right away. I then left and
                        went to find where my bus would be leaving from which wasn't too far away, there were a few people
                        there and a few buses going through until mine would appear. It was helpful they shouted which bus
                        it was as there were no information screens to see which bus it was other than on the side or front
                        of the bus, there was someone waiting for a bus and saw the one there head away - that one hadn't
                        done an announcement and they had to run after it as it turned out it was the one they wanted to get
                        on, luckily it had stopped at lights so they were able to board it quickly! That experience meant I
                        made sure to check each bus carefully and make sure I was at the front so could get on and not miss
                        mine either, thankfully there was no worry about that one as it was announced not only over the PA
                        system but also in person so you couldn't miss it!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Getting the bus back long distance was the first time I had ever done that outside of a school trip
                        to France, but I had a seat at the front and although there wasn't as much room as on a train it was
                        comfortable and there would only be a few stops before I got home, in another turn of luck it
                        stopped in Sunderland where there was a Metro stop, so decided to get off there instead of Newcastle
                        and was able to make my way back home to Gateshead a little bit quicker that way! In going to and
                        coming from Scottish Summit I had travelled by taxi, train, tram, bus, and Metro. I hadn't expected
                        to almost get the full set of transport options but it turned out that way, it was a great
                        opportunity to go especially to be surprised by the changes to Manchester, I would certainly want to
                        go back there again and enjoyed the tram and thought if had something like that in Newcastle /
                        Gateshead then it would be just as good, we of course had trams decades ago but just seeing that and
                        knowing it helped contribute to the growth of the city, it would be good to see something like that
                        back home, although we do have the Metro, it doesn't go everywhere!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Scottish Summit for me was a great learning experience, it will help me present my own talks better
                        along with learning a few things that I think will be useful to know in the future, plus it was
                        great to visit Manchester. I think there are a few ways things could have gone differently along and
                        although had a few problems they could be overcome - I think that's the strength in any experience
                        is to see the positive side of things and not dwell on the negative such as when things go wrong or
                        are cancelled! Overall, it was a great couple of days to travel down, attend the sessions and come
                        back with many new things I learned or experience at Scottish Summit!
