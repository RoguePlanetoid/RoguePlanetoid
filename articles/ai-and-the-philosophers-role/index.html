                            Large Language Models are the most recent, well-known and important development in Artificial Intelligence, the most famous of which being ChatGPT 
                            from OpenAI which produced the most impressive results when you could simply type in something you wanted whether that be a question to get an answer 
                            or to create something based upon a prompt. Since then that technology has been adopted by companies such as Microsoft with their Copilot they 
                            introduced in Bing, then Windows and in Microsoft 365 from Word to PowerPoint and Excel. Large Language Models have also been created by other 
                            companies such as Google with Gemini and many more start-ups either building their own large language models or building on those created by OpenAI, 
                            Google and others. These Large Language Models increase is sophistication and abilities and can include the latest information publicly available 
                            from the world wide web to your own company information that can be kept separate and confidential.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Large Language Models are simply language calculators they take an input in the form of a prompt which they break that down into what is known as a 
                            token and then find what the most likely outcome for a token based upon that prompt should be and continue to repeat that process until a stopping 
                            condition has been reached, this behaviour in many early and current Large Language Models gives the illusion that it is typing but it is merely 
                            the time it takes for the next token to be calculated. There is a factor known as temperature which controls the randomness of results which can be 
                            more precise for a lower temperature or more creative with a higher temperature but turn that up too high and the results become too chaotic, but 
                            when balanced correctly a Large Language Model will produce something close to the output required and if not users can easily keep changing their 
                            prompt or add more to the prompt to get the output they desire. Since Large Language Models can produce any output that is requested of them the 
                            addition of a system prompt can be used to control the output by making sure the assistant behaves as needed so a flight booking assistant is told 
                            to help only with that activity, or a customer support assistant restricts itself to only the help and information for that activity and not to answer 
                            or do anything outside of that activity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Large Language Models do have problems due to the fact they are the sum of all the human knowledge they possibly could have ingested from public 
                            sources as well as offering that knowledge to any system that uses those models as DPD learned that their delivery assistant was giving more than 
                            just information about deliveries but would swear and write songs about the company in a less than flattering manner. Another recent example was 
                            from a chatbot for flight booking system for Air Canada that told a customer about something that wasn't consistent with the policy of the airline 
                            which ended up in court as they airline tried to defend the mistake saying they weren't responsible for the answers it gave implying it was a separate 
                            legal entity responsible for its own actions, which of course the court disagreed with and considered it just another source of information that should 
                            be just as reliable as a page on their website, the information there in this case was obtained from their own data but the chatbot had hallucinated 
                            the information it had provided to that customer that turned out not to be correct but had to be honoured by the airline.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Large Language Models also have another problem, that rather than getting things wrong from information they have ingested but reflect the less 
                            idealist parts of society, all the injustice and bias and unfairness of society is reflected back to users like a mirror, we expect AI to be a 
                            perfect reflection of what we want but it instead returns things where sexism, racism or other inequalities have tarnished the results. An example 
                            of this is a recruitment website that used AI to help target jobs was recommending secretarial jobs to women more than men, as within the data it 
                            had ingested historically that was the group that those jobs were most occupied by so the AI continued to perpetuate this stereotype without 
                            realising that this job should be shown equally regardless of gender, but the data did not tell the model this so it didn't exhibit this behaviour, 
                            in that case the system was specifically driven through the use of the system prompt to evenly recommend this job to everyone regardless of gender 
                            to help overcome the inherent bias in the data it was using to make those recommendations. Large Language Models are not the only models that have 
                            had problems, this includes image generation models which Google found with their Gemini model, which was making sure that the results of user prompts 
                            should create a diverse image but was doing that sometimes where that was completely inappropriate, it was a noble aim to make sure the Gemini did not 
                            return stereotypical images based on user prompts but did not consider that this is not appropriate in certain contexts as again the model would need 
                            to be told not to do this.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Philosophy is where the fundamental questions about existence, reasoning, knowledge, and more is discussed, it is literally the love of wisdom, and 
                            it is that wisdom that is sorely needed with the rise of Large Language Models. They reflect society as it is too well with all those historical biases 
                            as at the moment it is often a perfect reflection of the information it has been provided or has access to but it needs to imperfect and be told to 
                            override the bias contained in the information within the model, they need to be better than we were to allow us to be better than we are. 
                            Large Language Models that are developed now or in future need a philosopher's role to ensure they reflect the ideals of society not just the ideas, 
                            it needs to understand that even if historically one group was favoured over another that should not be the case, developers can ensure a 
                            Large Language Model works at all so that users can get the information they want but the role of a philosopher may be required to make sure that these 
                            models behave as they should be not as they have been. We're rightly appalled when images are either more or less diverse than they would be, answers 
                            are more biased than they should be, or results are historically warped than they could be. We can solve this by bring the humanity into Artificial 
                            Intelligence with philosophy, when it comes to asking about historical information it should be accurate and show us the values of the past, but when 
                            it comes to new information it should be based upon the best possibilities, that may seem idealistic but may produce a Large Language Model that produces 
                            results that help better society rather than perpetuate the ills of society.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Philosophers or philosophy should be a key part of designing Large Language Models, as a developer myself I can understand how to write a system prompt 
                            or programme the interface and get it to function, others can drive the creation and innovation of them and make sure they include as much or a little 
                            information as needed for them to operate as expected, but the philosopher can make sure that the system is producing the output that represents the 
                            goals of the system whether that be to produce only information about parcel deliveries, accurate information when booking flights, recommending jobs 
                            evenly and fairly or producing content with the appropriate optimism or pessimism. It sadly isn't possible to solve all the injustice, unfairness, inequality, 
                            and bias in the world, nor should that be hidden away when it shouldn't be. It should be the goal of anything driven by Artificial Intelligence to 
                            deliver what we need and want most even if that needs to be an imperfect reflection of us that results in a more beneficial and balanced outcome that 
                            may even, over time allow the reflection to improve as the information becomes less tainted by the mistakes of the past so that future Large Language 
                            Models could be greatly improved thanks to philosophy and the love of wisdom with the philosopher's role.
