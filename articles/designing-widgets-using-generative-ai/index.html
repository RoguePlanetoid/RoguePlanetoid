                        <h3>Windows Widgets</h3>
                        <h4>Overview</h4>
                        <p>
                            Windows 11 enables seamless productivity and creativity designed for modern users including Widgets for quick access to information all from the click 
                            or swipe of the Widgets board.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Windows 11</h4>
                        <p>
                            Windows 11 is Microsoft's latest and most powerful operating system that helps developers, consumers and businesses get things done and is optimised for 
                            productivity such as snap assist to organise Windows and Widgets providing information at-a-glance. Windows 11 is elevated for games with reality 
                            rivalling visuals and an elevated entertainment experience along with being enhanced with AI itself with Copilot which can kick start creativity 
                            or act as an intelligent assistant. Windows 11 features along with latest hardware such as Copilot + PCs can be found at 
                            <a href="https://www.windows.com" target="_blank">windows.com</a>
                        </p>
                        <h4>Widgets</h4>
                        <p>
                            Windows 11 features Widgets which enable quick-and-easy access to at-a-glance information without needing to open an application or website including 
                            built-in and third-party Microsoft Store widgets. You can organise and save time with the Widgets Board by using the built-in widgets such as calendar, 
                            news, weather and more or get third-party Widgets such as Spotify from the Microsoft Store. Widgets can be customised based on your own interests and 
                            preferences or they can be personalised to show what is important to you. They can be interactive to engage with any content directly or they can be 
                            dynamic to support real-time updates to text or images. Widgets are designed using Adaptive Cards which can be updated partially with databinding or 
                            can be replaced completely with another Adaptive Card.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Adaptive Cards</h3>                        
                        <h4>Overview</h4>
                        <p>
                            Adaptive Cards are platform-agnostic UI snippets in JSON to create rich interactive templates across platforms or services such as Windows Widgets, 
                            Microsoft Teams and Viva Connections and are are used to exchange at-a-glance content using JSON-based templates supporting elements such as text and 
                            images along with layouts such as columns and tables. Adaptive Cards can be created using the JSON schema or by using the drag-and-drop designer to 
                            add elements and structure, modify properties and preview output. They can be updated dynamically based on user actions for a responsive experience 
                            or when data changes to ensure information is always up to date. Adaptive Cards documentation, samples, schema, designer and more can be found 
                            at <a href="https://www.adaptivecards.io" target="_blank">adaptivecards.io</a>.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Schema</h4>
                        <div class="row row-cols-1 row-cols-md-2 g-3">
                            <div class="col position-relative">
                                <div class="card">
                                    <img src="../images/designing-windows-widgets-using-generative-ai-schema.png" class="img-fluid" style="max-height:720px" alt="Adaptive Cards Schema"/>
                                </div>                         
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Adaptive Cards use a Schema that defines the JSON structure of the Adaptive Card with version 1.5 including Card Elements, Containers Actions, Inputs 
                            and Types for the body and actions. Card Elements include TextBlock, RichTextBlock and Image for text or graphics along with Media and MediaSource to 
                            display video in an Adaptive Card. Containers can be used to arrange information including Column, Table, FactSet and Fact to display key / value pairs 
                            in an Adaptive Card. Actions such as ToggleVisiblity with TargetElement to show or hide Card Elements or Submit to send Inputs from an Adaptive Card. 
                            Inputs like Text, Number, Date, Time and ChoiceSet with Choice can be used to submit values to a client from an Adaptive Card. Types are supported 
                            depending on client like the Widgets Board such as BackgroundImage to customise the look-and-feel of an Adaptive Card.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Designer</h4>
                        <div class="row row-cols-1 row-cols-md-2 g-3">
                            <div class="col position-relative">
                                <div class="card">
                                    <img src="../images/designing-windows-widgets-using-generative-ai-designer.png" class="img-fluid" style="max-height:720px" alt="Adaptive Cards Designer"/>
                                </div>                         
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Adaptive Cards can also be created visually using the Designer where you can start from a JSON Schema or explore a variety of samples when creating a New Card. 
                            Adaptive Cards Designer to create the Card Structure for an Adaptive Card by dragging-and-dropping Card Elements such as Containers, Elements and Inputs along 
                            with being able to Select host app such as Widgets Board then view Light or Dark theme and Small, Medium or Large Container size. Adaptive Cards Designer supports 
                            updating properties for Card Elements such as data context for data binding, layout, styling, content and visibility along with Card Payload Editor to edit and 
                            copy the JSON and Sample Data Editor to test data binding for Adaptive Cards.

                        <h3>Generative AI</h3>
                        <h4>Overview</h4>
                        <div class="row row-cols-1 row-cols-md-2 g-3">
                            <div class="col position-relative">

                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Generative AI saves time and effort by leveraging models to assist with generating new ideas, automating content creation or formatting information. Generative AI 
                            features AI models that are trained on large datasets that can contain text, images or other types of content. Those models can learn any patterns or structure in 
                            the data and to understand underlying context of the data. Generative AI can use patterns and context to generate new content by drawing on what it learned during 
                            training along with output that can be fine-tuned by refining prompts to produce more accurate and relevant results.

                        <h3>Summary</h3>
                        <p>
                            Windows 11 from Microsoft helps developers, consumers and businesses be more productive with Copilot and more informed with features like Widgets. Widgets provide easy-to-use 
                            dynamic or interactive access to information at-a-glance with build-in or third-party Widgets using Adaptive Cards. Adaptive Cards are templates for Widgets created using the 
                            JSON schema or drag-and-drop Designer and using Generative AI. Generative AI like ChatGPT or Copilot can be prompted to design Adaptive Card for Windows Widgets quickly and 
                            easily.
