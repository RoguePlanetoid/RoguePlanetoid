                        <h3>Proto</h3>
                        <p>
                            Proto is now run as part of the Digital Catapult. They run immersive technology programmes such as boot camps and develop immersive virtual production but also have 
                            opportunities to access technology which would not be readily accessible. They also put together a performance with led volume along with full VR and sold out every 
                            performance of this experience that was held. They are working with the new arena that is being built on Gateshead Quays. Proto helps drive productive and opportunities 
                            across the North East. They work from fully enclosed VR environments through to AR which overlays digital information onto the real world. Immersive technology with 
                            spatial computing and can also integrate the sense of touch with haptic to help explore virtual worlds. VR is about presence and embodied interaction and can't be 
                            replicated with any other technologies and can also help save money such as providing digital interactive training environments and can have immersive training rooms 
                            for things like forklift truck training. There is no AR without scene understanding. Virtual production such as Stage Craft from Disney used in The Mandalorian which 
                            uses a games engine to create a virtual image with LED volume and motion tracking for cameras and can recreate environments in a studio. There is a 10 metre wide 3 
                            metre high screen at Proto in Gateshead along with a smaller screen on wheels and can create real reflections from screen and this will be launched in the new year 
                            and allow smaller production companies to access this technology in the North East. They are also working with a studio in London and have remote studio using 5G 
                            and will be running open days in early February. They are using Unreal Engine but will also be looking into Unity as they are technology agnostic. There are two 
                            types of booking for R&D to help companies use it and become part of their process and will take commercial bookings as much of that is booked months and years 
                            in advance. Aim is to make it accessible to everyone particularly SMEs. It is funded and subsidised with 50% being R&D and will be creating case studies.
