                    <h3>What can we learn from Python in C# - Andrew Buckingham</h3>
                    <h4>Collections</h4>
                    <p>
                        Collections are the mainstay of most applications, and everyone has their favourite IEnumerables or Arrays. In Python you can just pass in 
                        arrays with square brackets e.g. ProcessData([1,2,3]) which looks like Python but is C#, we can also use the .. spread syntax. So, what's going on? 
                        A new language feature is collection expressions which has a lot of magic under the hood to make this work. There are lots of different ways to 
                        initialise a list you can use a Span but with this syntax it will do that for you and an efficient way of passing around collections.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Classes</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you have a simple class that performs a calculation, that takes a list and stores it in a variable and can express this in C# and you can do 
                        this in Python where can declare things in the constructor but can also split apart some variables, so do get more like Python is we can use the 
                        new .NET 8 format to create a shorter programme that the equivalent Python programme, you can use an expression bodied method and can destruct 
                        the values directly in C#, it is more compact now than the equivalent Python syntax. What's going on? Some magic syntax includes 
                        Primary Constructors.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Clocks</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you're not Unit Testing your time calculations then your programme is not production ready, for example there are a lot of assumptions such as 
                        server and client clocks are the same and it will be on local time etc. If you write some code that deals with time you cannot prove it is correct 
                        until you have written a unit test for it. You could create a simple example to perform a simple time calculation such as something that tells you 
                        that it is tomorrow it would have to test things in real time, it would have to delay for a day to then check it works. There is now a Time Provider 
                        that decouples the code from the System Clock and can inject this dependency which is passed in from outside the application and this can be provided 
                        by a Unit Test, so you can advance the fake time to tomorrow instead of waiting for a day. It is the equivalent of opening up the system clock and 
                        moving it on a day and can then write the unit tests you need which will solve many of the problems when dealing with time in Unit Tests.

                    <h3>Take a Note of XAML with .NET 8 - Peter Bull</h3>
                    <h4>.NET & XAML</h4>
                    <p>
                        .NET started as .NET Framework in 2002 but now .NET is the free, modern, and unified open-source cross platform framework from Microsoft 
                        that can be used to build apps and services for Cloud, Web, Desktop, Mobile, Gaming, IoT or AI.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        XAML is eXtensible Application Markup Language and is an XML-based declarative markup language that can define objects with rotations, animations, 
                        or other effects along with vector-based controls using styles or templates and more. XAML allows developers to decouple the design and user interface 
                        of an application from the implementation of an application including events, business objects and other code. XAML supports databinding from source 
                        values to target properties including converting values to present data to users or to allow interaction with data from users.
                    </p>
                    <h4>XAML & .NET Platforms</h4>
                    <p>
                        XAML and .NET Platforms include Windows Presentation Foundation, codenamed Avalon, first introduced XAML in 2006 part of .NET Framework 3.0 but today is still a 
                        major part of .NET 8. Windows App SDK, codenamed Project Reunion, first released in 2021 using WinUI 3 with XAML and leverages the power of .NET 8. 
                        .NET MAUI or .NET Multi-platform App UI first released in 2022 enables cross-platform development using XAML with .NET 8.
                    </p>
                    <h4>XAML & .NET Toolkits</h4>
                    <p>
                        Toolkits available from NuGet providing additional functionality for projects using .NET and XAML such as Comentsys Toolkit for .NET Standard supporting .NET 8 
                        includes cross-platform functionality used for databinding useful in all XAML-based .NET applications. ModernWpfUI by Kinnara brings modern styles and controls 
                        to Windows Presentation Foundation although built-in support for modern controls is coming to WPF in .NET. Windows Community Toolkit is a collection of helper 
                        functions, custom controls and services for applications using WinUI 3 such as Windows App SDK. NET MAUI Community Toolkit is a collection of common elements 
                        that tend to be replicated across apps created using .NET MAUI.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Windows Presentation Foundation - WPF Application</h4>
                    <p>
                        Windows Presentation Foundation was the first platform to introduce XAML and allows .NET 8 developers to create a WPF Application that targets 
                        Windows desktop from Windows 7 to Windows 11 with the .NET Desktop development workload installed for Visual Studio 2022.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                    </p>
                    <h4>Windows App SDK - Win UI 3 in Desktop</h4>
                    <p>
                        Windows App SDK is the successor to Universal Windows Platform available as the Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK NuGet package and updated every six months 
                        with XAML like Windows Presentation Foundation. Windows App SDK combined Universal Windows Platform with Win32 using WinUI 3 as the user interface 
                        layer that features modern controls that use Microsoft's Fluent Design system,. Windows App SDK allows .NET 8 developers to create a WinUI 3 in Desktop 
                        application for Windows from Windows 10 1809 to Windows 11 by installing the .NET desktop development workload along with the Windows App SDK C# templates 
                        for Visual Studio 2022. 
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <h4>.NET MAUI - .NET MAUI App</h4>
                    <p>
                        .NET MAUI or .NET Multi-platform App UI is based on Xamarin using Mono which was first released in 2011 and then was acquired by Microsoft in 2016 to later 
                        become part of .NET as .NET MAUI. .NET MAUI uses XAML like Windows Presentation Foundation or Windows App SDK, but it has many significant differences 
                        control names, supported controls and property names. .NET MAUI allows developers using .NET 8 to create a cross-platform .NET MAUI App targeting desktop 
                        on Windows using WinUI 3 and macOS using Mac Catalyst, along with mobile on Android and iOS plius Tizen from Samsung by installing the .NET Multi-platform 
                        App UI development workload for Visual Studio 2022.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>
                        .NET 8 is the latest version of .NET that was released in November 2023 and allows developers to build modern applications and services for any platform. 
                        XAML allows developers to create modern applications with decoupled user interfaces including support for data binding for interaction with values from code. 
                        Windows Presentation Foundation allows developers to build a WPF Application targeting Windows 7 to Windows 11 using XAML, .NET. Windows App SDK allows 
                        developers to build a WinUI in Desktop application using XAML and .NET for Windows 10 1809 to Windows 11 and .NET MAUI allows developers to build cross-platform 
                        applications for desktop on Windows and macOS or mobile on Android and iOS.
                    </p>
