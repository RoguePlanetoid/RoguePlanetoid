                        About
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        True Crime Forum Newcastle organised by Joccoaa Tyne Gray was held on 12th July 2025 and was an 
                        opportunity to participate in thought provoking workshops along with hearing from a diverse range 
                        of speakers and local podcasters held in the historic venue of Blackfriars in Newcastle upon Tyne. 
                        True Crime Forum Newcastle was a great opportunity to get multiple perspectives from the world of 
                        true crime with three tracks to choose from and a great chance to go along and meet new people and 
                        catch up with familiar faces including those from Crimecon such as special guest Stuart Blues from 
                        the British Murders podcast and Kacey Baker host of the Cult Vault Podcast who would be delivering 
                        one of the sessions. It was a really amazing day with informative sessions along with fantastic 
                        conversations and so much more. You can find out more about the event

                        The CSI Effect - Reality vs Drama - Angela Davies & Dionne Watson (The Crime Scene Insiders Podcast)
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Angela and Dionne host The Crime Scene Insiders - Under the Barrier Tape which is a new podcast
                        started in May this year, they are two ex-Crime Scene Investigators who bring a CSI twist and bring
                        a bit of reality. They have access to a wealth of guests from the network of over twenty years'
                        experience and have recently interviewed the police commissioner of New York and covered Raoul Moat
                        case on their podcast.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Angela and Dionne met in 2005 at Teesside University and graduated in 2008 and joined Northumbria
                        Police where they both dealt with different cases as Crime Scene Investigators but also volume crime
                        which are crimes that happen often from burglaries to murders. They also mentioned that less common
                        cases can be interesting as it gives them an opportunity to think outside the box.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They both left the police in 2012 and founded CSI Training and Events which they have been doing for
                        thirteen years and are also disaster response consultants to keep their skills up to date and worked
                        on a number of airline disasters such as MH-17 which was shot down where they worked for eighteen
                        months travelling back and forth to Holland and they have worked on other airline crashes often
                        travelling via the very airline that was involved in the disaster.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They have also launched and Crime Scene Assistant app to aid forensic awareness to help others on a
                        crime scene. This a front-line training tool to help first responders which is something they are
                        focusing on along with the podcast. They had been discussing doing the podcast for years and liked
                        the sound of their own voices which is what brought them to the True Crime Forum Event in Newcastle
                        to talk about CSI effect about reality vs drama.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The CSI effect came about due to dramas on TV such as CSI, CSI Miami and more which has built up
                        some expectations about what people expect. The biggest impacts include roles where on TV one person
                        does everything from arrest to interviews and even postmortem but in reality, it is a big team
                        effort where Crime Scene Investigators will send things off to specialists and those in forensic
                        disciplines who often stay in the lab.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of them got called into a cell to photograph someone and it is usual to always have an officer
                        with them but upon entering and looked around the officer had left. So, it can be intimidating
                        sometimes especially if they have heard the person has been aggressive, but they're not dressed in
                        police uniforms so tend to be better treated especially as they are often recording what has
                        happened to them and find ways of building rapport with the people they have to deal with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dress and style depicted in TV dramas are their favourite where people are dressed their best with
                        sunglasses and driving SUVs, but the actual truth is suits and driving plain white vans. Their other
                        uniform is black combats with black polo shirt with a badge and black boots as they only wear PPE
                        when at certain crime scenes and if collecting DNA there is a full kit including double gloves or
                        even respirators for biological hazards but doesn't help with the smell. TV portrays the job as
                        glamorous, but crime scene investigation is not at all glamorous in reality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Technological advance is shown on TV way beyond what it is possible and what is available is so
                        costly that most police forces often don't use them. Fingerprints can take a couple of weeks for
                        results to come back and for DNA there is a backlog, and labs are private now so there is a lot of
                        competition, so price has gone up. Usually, they have to look hard at what they have to send off due
                        to the cost or do what they can in house and bring other types of investigation in or look at
                        strategy to see what evidence will drive an investigation further.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Certainty of evidence is often depicted in TV drama but there is no certainty in forensics in
                        reality, but it is about probability and context of evidence. You may find fingerprints but there
                        may have been a legitimate reason for that so need to consider context. Crime scenes are often so
                        clean in TV compared to reality where it is always high drama, high profile and very clean scenes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The consequence of the CSI effect is greater expectations such as jurors expecting more weight from
                        forensic evidence. Police also have high expectation that they often tell victims of crime about.
                        They had an example of a scene where they were expected to take samples of cat but that wouldn't
                        help prove anything, there's no DNA database for cats. There was another case where an ambulance had
                        been egged and those there had been told to keep the eggshells for fingerprints but there were only
                        small fragments and eggs are not a good surface for fingerprints anyway. They also mentioned a case
                        where a superintendent's car had a brick put through the window, but it had been raining and
                        fingerprinting doesn't work as the compounds clump in the wet and felt it was a waste of time. A lot
                        of students are jumping on courses some are better than others and competition is really high, and
                        they have an unreasonable expectation of the job such as not wanting to see blood or dead bodies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fingerprints can be scanned directly with Live Scan or can even use a portable fingerprint scanner,
                        but these are not common due the cost, but it does allow fingerprints from victims to be scanned for
                        exclusionary purposes. Fingerprints are sweat and the fingerprinting compound binds to the proteins
                        in the sweat and fingerprints can even be recovered after a while. Fingerprints can also be taken
                        from an unidentified body to determine who they are or compare against samples from someone they
                        think it is and often this is used in the disaster response arena. For a body the hands can be
                        massaged to release the tendons to open the hand and can use stickers to take the fingerprints but
                        is easier when have someone to help. There was a situation where they had massaged the hand, and it
                        had opened but when they went to grab something the hand snapped shut and they got their finger
                        stuck in the hand. Other methods are used as may get parts of bodies or they are in poor condition
                        so often put in fluid to be able to get ridge detail or there is degloving where they can take the
                        skin off a finger then put a glove on their own hand and then put the skin on the glove to take the
                        fingerprint.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Offenders sometimes don't want to give fingerprints willingly, but it is allowed to take them with
                        reasonable force, if necessary, this is due to it being seen as a non-intimate sample so they will
                        work in pairs, but the fingerprints still need to have good quality. When taking fingerprints from
                        people they do this to make sure it is done in the right way as there is a knack to it to get the
                        right details and make sure fingers and hands are correct.

                        Behind the Veil: Understanding Cults & Coercive Control - Kacey Baker, MSc (Cult Vault Podcast)
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Kacey is the host of the Cult Vault Podcast and covered topics such as abuse in cults and abuse
                        beyond cults including workplace abuse and more. Kacey also defined the key concepts of cults
                        coercive control and undue influence and recognise physiological tactics, understand experiences and
                        promote critical thinking and compassionate engagement with survivors. Kacey also facilitated
                        participation from the audience to share their own thoughts and stories in confidence, so are not
                        shared here, but it was interesting to hear how the some of the topics may have personally resonated
                        with some of those there, but there was also the understanding that if anyone felt uncomfortable
                        with the topics covered they could leave if needed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cult is defined differently depending on where you look or the definition will change depending on
                        who you ask. It is people who have been deprived of their autonomy, there can be religious cults or
                        organisations such as multi-level marketing that can often be defined with cult-like language. for
                        example, various cults could be financial control. The dictionary definition of cult can also be an
                        unorthodox or spurious religion. You could be devoted to people but not sure how people could be
                        devoted to a cult leader. A voodoo or satanic cult of the occult can be mixed up with a cult, before
                        Kacey started her podcast she wouldn't have known the difference between those.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another definition of a cult is a group, religious organisation or family structure of any size led
                        by a charismatic leader and cults control their members through manipulation, abuse and coercion.
                        These groups can feature transcendent belief systems and create self-sealing systems from which
                        followers find it difficult to escape. You may see a lot of the time abusing and controller parents
                        or caregiver or where children can invert this to control their environment in a cult-like way.
                        Cults aren't just an exotic thing away from us they can be in schools, workplaces and closer to
                        home.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Kacey started the Cult Vault podcast during lockdown and was hearing people's personal stories and
                        realised the way they consumed true crime podcast was unethical and they were detached from the
                        stories and that these were real people and real people's lives. It took them a really long time to
                        reach that realisation and through speaking to people and hearing their experiences were able to
                        change that mindset. Something else that they found when speaking people in modern slavery, in the
                        prison system or basic training in marines and armed forces and there were so many things that
                        resonate over and over again, they were hearing the same patterns such as speech patterns, what to
                        do, who they can live with. There is something happening that hasn't been named, or they haven't
                        come across and they realised there was a thread running throughout these different experiences.

                        and defined his eight criteria for thought reform after interviewing prisoners of the Chinese
                        Communist “re-education” camps in the 1950s examining how totalitarian systems control minds. The
                        eight criteria included Milieu control which is controlling what people see, hear, read and say to
                        limit access to outside ideas or opinions along with mystical manipulation which is where leaders
                        claim events are part of a higher plan including making coincidences seem like miracles to prove
                        their power. Other criteria included confession where you must confess your wrongs which is often
                        one publicly to shame or control, sacred science where the groups beliefs are the absolute truth and
                        you're not allowed to question them, loading the language where they used special words or phrases
                        to control thinking and complex ideas are reduced to simple slogans. Criteria also included doctrine
                        over person where the group's beliefs are more important than your own experience and you're wrong
                        if your feelings don't match the doctrine along with dispensing of existence where only loyal
                        members deserve to live of be saved and outsiders or doubters are often seen as enemies or
                        worthless.

                        Steven Hassan's BITE Model of authoritarian control which re-describes that criteria to then apply
                        them to see if there is cult-like behaviour in someone's life with behaviour control including
                        promoting obedience and dependence, dictating where you live and with whom, restrict and control
                        your sexuality, exploiting you financially and deprive you of sleep. Information control including
                        deliberately withhold or distort information, forbid you from speak with members or critics, divide
                        information into US vs THEM doctrine and self-report feelings or infractions or spy on others.
                        Thought control including change your identity often your name, endure hypnotic or suggestible
                        state, use thought-terminating cliches and reject critical thinking or doubt. Emotional control
                        includes instil fear evert leaving the group, label certain emotions of evil, unworthy or wrong
                        along with promote feelings of guilt, shame, unworthiness plus shun you if you disobey or dissent
                        and teach that there is no happiness without the group.

                        If a person can control you in a specific way that is just another way that people can control you,
                        for example if you have no children then this is more time for the leader to control you or have
                        many children makes it harder to leave. Many cults will provide the only literature you can read and
                        are not allowed to speak to outsiders or with thought control will be stripped from those things
                        that make you individual as they want people to look and think the same. A lot of self-policing will
                        come in where you go to leadership about having thoughts and then there will be a punishment where
                        you are publicly berated or physical punishments especially children to stop natural child-like
                        behaviour and enforce that children should be seen and not heard.

                        Kacey mentioned that Jehovah's witnesses' can be perceived as a cult due to the practice of
                        shunning. They are encouraged to not communicate with people outside that faith space so for example
                        children find it hard to make friends outside the faith. If anyone takes part in anything that isn't
                        seen as part of the faith then they will be shunned such as being looked past as if they don't
                        exist, when people show autonomy and use their voice then they can be excommunicated from their
                        friends and family.

                        Jim Jones is the most infamous cult story due to the tragedy at Peoples Temple with death of over
                        800 people described as a murder suicide, but it is a mass murder and even if people drank the
                        poison willingly then would be hard to describe it willingly. On the day the mass murder happened
                        you can see that the children were being forcefully injected by adults with Flavor Ade combined with
                        Cyanide, but is often mistakenly said to be Kool-Aid, which is where the term "drinking the
                        Kool-Aid" comes from which means to mean to buying into someone else's belief system.

                        Charles Manson is another infamous cult story and features on the logo of The Cult Vault, he was 4 foot 11 inches, and
                        it seems that maybe what he did fed into the culture of the time which may have made people more
                        vulnerable. There are nine confirmed murders with cult like control and criminal conspiracy with
                        regards to psychedelics. His case has made the news quite a lot, documentaries and there is even
                        talk about who will inherit his estate as he made quite a lot of money from being so notorious.

                        Shoko Ashahara founder of Aum Shinrikyo who was behind the attacks on the Tokyo Subway. He was
                        partially blind, and his parents couldn't look after him and was sent to a school for the blind
                        where he would control those who were blind there. He tried to get a lot of members into political
                        power including doctors, lawyers and politicians who were staunch members of the cult. There were
                        many deaths including the Tokyo Subway sarin gas attacks as well as life-line debilitating injuries
                        such as blindness. Before this there had been unsuccessful sarin gas attacks but there were
                        successful political assassinations. If people carried out certain tasks on his behalf, he would let
                        them drink their blood and was a grifter and con artist where he would teach people how to meditate.
                        He would put people in a bath and raise the temperature until they died, he would threaten people's
                        families and ritualistically humiliate them.

                        Shoko Ashahara and Aum Shinrikyo led to policy reform in Japan as they banned cults but there was a systematic built
                        up to the more dramatic events, so there can be an effort on identifying the conditions and educate
                        on these signs. Unification Church also known as the Moonies have been paying back the mandatory
                        tithing that was paid, and all this money had to be paid back and therefore the Unification Church
                        could no longer operate in certain capacities in Japan. However, the Church of Scientology isn't
                        banned in Japan and in the United Kingdom and their building has a sign outside about getting a free
                        personality test where people may go in and not know anything about them and then people may see the
                        signs and change in their personality as they get more involved but there are people who are
                        outspoken about them but they get harassed for speaking out. The wife of the current head of the
                        Church of Scientology hasn't been seen for two decades although there have been wellness checks by
                        the police where they seemingly have been seen by them.

                        Paul Mackenzie was responsible for the mass death of over 400 people in Kenya who were starved to
                        death, because they had been told to do this to meet Jesus. A lot of the victims were found buried
                        in the forest, this happened in 2023 but isn't really known and is a case of something that should
                        have been in the news a lot more. He used an isolated and impoverished area to say he would solve
                        their issues and help them build communities but is also under investigation for organ trafficking
                        which is one of the most prolific issues in that part of the world. They haven't been able to prove
                        the trafficking element yet but was using religion and community and there were mass graves without
                        people really noticing as a whole community was brought into this. Once people are brought into
                        something with word of mouth and being brought into conformity is the most successful strategy of
                        cults. If you don't talk about these things then history will repeat itself, can have a macro cult
                        where will be punished about talking about something that can be intrenched in society.

                        Joseph Di Mambro was a case in Canada with the Order of the Solar Temple where there were burnings
                        across Switzerland and Canada. They were actually a well-known group at the time for not bad
                        reasons, the leaders were charismatic, and they held events with magic shows but had seemly
                        spontaneous things that happened without explanation. They had a tier system where people signed
                        over their life savings and when the leaders exhausted the money and none of the things that
                        happened, they systematically murdered people across their French speaking locations and eventually
                        killed themselves, but it wasn't a religious cult but made up of people who were well standing in
                        the community.

                        David Koresh with over seventy people killed and longest standoff of over fifty days. Groups are to
                        seem appealing, and David Koresh was one of the most charismatic leaders and people would call him
                        Moses and put himself as the father of everyone. The Branch Davidians had a female leader and he was
                        a wayward wonderer and infiltrated himself into them where he got into a relationship with her and
                        then they started to do more things like stockpiling weapons and armed forces training and forbade
                        husbands to live with their wives, he was a prolific sexual offender, and he managed to leverage
                        himself into a position of power. David said there was an impending doom's day which was the reason
                        to stockpile the weapons, and it was this stock piling got the attention of the ATF who wanted to
                        surrender himself which he refused and brought in the FBI, but it was them who seemly started the
                        fire.

                        ailments and wee nomadic. There was a lot of mass graves in the areas they have moved through, a lot
                        of followers were put inside a church and were burned but had been told they would receive their own
                        revelations from God which used social conformance to grow the group and they got anything they
                        could of any kind from anyone and they have never been found or caught. It was such an isolated area
                        there is little information out there.

                        Marshall Applewhite and Bonnie Nettles co ran the Heaven's Gate cult related to Hale Bopp comet,
                        they were a huge fan of music would be classed as a UFO cult. They had very specific rules about
                        making food including the ingredients and exactly what is done. 39 people died when the members
                        completed mutual suicide which they describe as murder by coercion. They believed they would ascent
                        onto the tail of the Hale Bopp comet, and they would meet up with a UFO, it was a significant event
                        with the comet as it only comes around every 2,500 years. They cut themselves off from people and
                        did stop recruiting although the website for Heaven's Gate is still around as there are two people
                        who were left around and one of them was actually upset saying they didn't get the opportunity to
                        ascend and was left behind.

                        Is all religion a cult? When Kacey started the podcast, they felt how could you have a belief system
                        when there is awfulness that happened but now believe that people have the right to believe what
                        they want as long as it doesn't infringe on other people's human rights. Online cults can recruit
                        across the entire globe and can isolate people anywhere and have more diverse ways to operate to
                        best control people everything around them. The TikTok Dance cult seems like people who you would
                        want to have in your personal sphere where they can demonstrate how they have done this for other
                        people with this rule of reciprocity where if you get something then you feel like you need to give
                        something in return and it can often be after so many things that have been done for you.

                        Where do you think you might be recruited? From birth, on the street, schools or universities,
                        online, in the workplace as there isn't anywhere where you can't be recruited. Why may someone
                        recruit? Is maybe to hit a target but tend to target vulnerable people such as people without strong
                        family connections or those at places that do addition recovery or people who struggle with social
                        situations. Cult leaders want people who are hardworking, committed and smart and striving to do
                        more in the world as these are personality traits that they look for. When someone has moved to a
                        new place or looking for ways to socialise then when offered to join a club and will go along where
                        you will be hit with so much positivity and support.

                        Coercive control is a form of abuse in which a perpetrator uses a pattern of non-physical tactics
                        such as intimidation, isolation, degradation, surveillance, restrictions on resources and threats to
                        systematically deprive someone of their autonomy, rights and sense of self. In coercive systems in
                        workplaces or domestic situations but there is protection in the law from controlling behaviour and
                        there is training available to people to show what coercive control is. People in cults are being
                        exposed to coercive control but we're not looking at these things systematically.

                    <p>
                        Bethany has been touring with this talk including Crimecon and the Lit and Phil in Newcastle as she
                        leads Newcastle University's Ethics on True Crime, which is media's longest running interest. The
                        audience has had a unique place in true crime and many of us haven't thought about how we produce
                        and consume true crime and talk about out ethical responsibilities in true crime and how new
                        generations will think about producing content. Think about the last piece of factual content that
                        has it routes in crime journalism from documentaries, podcasts and more. There was some court
                        reporting from 1932 that was something that was read for example and pack reporting and crime
                        journalism which started with the coverage of Jack the Ripper. Another was a story on the news of
                        was of a couple guys who crashed into an old people's home in Sunderland where people unfortunately
                        died.

                        Bethany is a crime journalist by trade and started with the Sunderland Echo and then on to others.
                        They were the victim of a street attack and took three years to get justice but wanted to make sense
                        of their experience by becoming a journalist including why did they or the perpetrators get
                        anonymity. Therefore, by the grace of God go I is an interesting idea and why they became interested
                        in becoming a crime reporter where they interviewed a range of victims and found many similar
                        circumstances to their own and wanted to bring a voice to victims. Bethany worked on a story of a
                        child who has been subject of various podcasts and documentaries with no right to their consent and
                        that person has no voice in this room let alone finding something on television about something that
                        happened to them.

                        greater than ever before. What you click and share has a greater impact than ever and can see
                        consequences of crime as clickbait such as the case of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, his suffering has been
                        used to make money with an article featuring the video with adverts for holidays, black Friday deals
                        and sales. If they had an issue with a headline, it could be changed or an advert that was
                        inappropriate you could have this moved but can still do this, but these things take time to be
                        changed.

                        family would feel when seeing a headline. Sometimes a lot these headlines position a crime that
                        something is shocking or unbelievable but perhaps it is less shocking as it happens more often than
                        the headline implies. A headline sometimes asks to make a moral judgement on a person, then we can
                        think they are a liar and therefore what else they would expect, presented as churnalism where there
                        is a blatant marketing subtext. Headlines can say someone appears the perfect husband, wife etc
                        until with regards to the person who was the victim can often make the perpetrator seem more
                        humanised than the victim. Someone had added pretty into a headline from a story Bethany had worked
                        on which wasn't great as it seemed like then the victim had more value because of that. The person
                        who is responsible for bringing in visitors to online newspapers use well established marketing
                        tools to create headlines that will drive traffic. The headline being a sell was just on the front
                        page of a newspaper thirty years ago but now clickbait has become a real disease with headlines,
                        also see this with series on Netflix which is marketed this way.

                        Podcasting and influencing world for true crime such as My Favourite Murder podcast who place a lot
                        of emphasis on the victim rather than learning more about the murderer and they don't over embellish
                        and don't read into things just tell the facts of the story. Eleanor Neale is a TikTok influence who
                        reads crime stories from a domestic realm where there is a growth of these who gather content from
                        other sources, they aren't the greatest fan of them but aren't certainly the worst where she has two
                        accounts for true crime or beauty based where they have these dual narratives are becoming more
                        common. There is a growing number of people of telling true crime stories when putting their makeup
                        on or drinking but there is often radical differences in ethical space where many podcasts put a lot
                        of effort into doing ethical content who put thought into what they do and not just taking second or
                        third hand content but going to court reports from the time which is much more likely to be ethical
                        content. Will be getting more and more traction in this space, but this content relies on crime and
                        court content which is increasingly becoming less common, in order to become a crime reporter you
                        need to know shorthand as can't record anything and need to have the correct qualifications, if the
                        content is not created in the right way then what will be sourced in ten to fifteen years.

                        People think about the most is the true crime documentary, such as making a murderer which is really
                        engaging initially but found it was really watered down and focused on the crime but then later
                        became more diluted and was more about the murderer as a person. How many of these are focused on
                        the criminal rather than the victims or even with Dahmer where can get bobbleheads and there is a
                        growth in dark fandom and dark tourism or even walking tours of Jack the Ripper tours which have
                        been going on since just after the case, but we don't probably think about that and was it ethical
                        going on the tour but there's no victim's survivor's families alive to this day. There is a focus on
                        these wronged men, but the women don't get the glorification in the same way such as Myra Hindley or
                        Rose West. The thought about the creation of a movie star was transposed onto some criminals where
                        belongings of Ted Bundy have been auctioned for thousands of pounds. The names of the victims are
                        often secondary and unknown in the narrative in well known cases with a humanisation and
                        glorification of the killers over the victims is quite common. There was a trial where clips for a
                        docuseries were used as the person didn't take the stand but had been interviewed for the
                        documentary although this wouldn't ever happen in UK law, there is UK law that prevents people from
                        making money from their crimes due to much more stringent media law.

                        Spotting ethical re-mediatisation over a commercial retelling where someone has taken an old crime
                        story but have done this in an ethical way and not just in a way to make money but also can be a
                        method to use to make sure creating ethical content. Could have new narrative about something that
                        is in the public interest, where something can have new lines that are in the public interest such
                        as the Yorkshire Ripper where misogyny played a part in the murders and how they took so long to be
                        caught or where victims are the main figures and are the guiding narrative and have been included
                        and shows they have been given the right of consent from the victims who will be impacted by the
                        content. Something may expose injustice, wrongfully accused or unethical practices in crime scene
                        investigations or in journalism in how it was covered or can even be something with a sense of
                        reconciliation.

                        The Jimmy Saville documentary on Netflix as a commercial retelling comes across sensationalised and
                        in the style of the way he approached himself. Bethany interviewed Jimmy Saville and confronted him
                        that he was a paedophile and knew of three victims who were willing to come forward, she was sent in
                        with the biggest photographer they could which showed how well known things were but the story was
                        spiked, but the story got out after his death because you can't defame him compared to when he was
                        alive as then would have been protected.

                        Crime is sensational by its nature, this isn't the issue, but the issue is doing the right thing
                        with this sensation to make a difference rather than make money. The public interest around things
                        can be that people get away with things because they are famous, there will be an upcoming case with
                        celebrity where will see someone tried for crimes they have essentially admitted to and for those
                        people who become so famous it masks what they have done. I'll be gone in the dark is a good example
                        of ethical re-mediatisation, the trailer is a much better impression with representation of the
                        victims where they were shown and puts a lot of emphasis on the effort it took to find him. The
                        person who wrote I'll be gone in the talk book Michelle McNamara had put together many cases and was
                        driving force around getting them caught but became addicted to prescription medication and
                        unfortunately died of an overdose.

                        When you're looking at content all day and all night then what the ethical responsibilities for
                        producers are, they have a duty of care to represent things correctly. Bethany had two archivists
                        who had envelopes of every case and could look at what was said many years later which was a
                        full-time job but there are none and these archives weren't looked after but if this information was
                        not on Google, it was dumped, so these rich original sources were lost.

                        One of the first editors of the Northern Echo W. T. Stead was a journalist and at 21 became the
                        second editor of the Northern Echo and took it from a pamphlet to a newspaper and is famous as being
                        the journalist who covered the case of Mary Ann Cotton and when the bodies were uncovered
                        interviewed the grave diggers as they uncovered the graves. He also talked about the widespread
                        practice of buying children and helped bring in the first age of consent laws. In an completely
                        unethical way he purchased a child who he took home but left it to the reader's imagination but she
                        had a much better life than the usual outcome but went to jail not for that but for not getting
                        written permission from her father and helped uncover the practice and it was the first consent law
                        in the world that girls had the right to consent for themselves. He also invented pack journalism
                        for the Jack the Ripper crimes and was often on the scene of a crime before the police and spoke to
                        some of those there who may have written the letters and he died on the Titanic.

                        Is sensation by nature bad, how can we steer this onto more ethical paths, the language of pamphlets
                        from the 1600s have the same kinds of words that sensational stories have the same kind of works we
                        have today. There were also cases of criminals telling their own story or there would be people who
                        would catch out street criminals and write about them. There were also pamphlets that uses the same
                        language to make out the king was a criminal which couldn't have happened without an established
                        language around crime. The idea of stalking or walking around the night was invented by journalism.
                        There was the Penny Dreadfuls and the like which notarised the highwaymen and there's also the
                        illustrated press which was said to be no more sensational than the rest except it was illustrated.
                        Investigation and the tabloid crime reporter with iconographic clothing of those who had one foot in
                        the criminal world and sometimes ahead of the police. W. T. Stead did a telephone interview decades
                        before once police force had a telephone. There is the growth of the mob as a true crime narrative
                        where crime rings were exposed or interviews with people to give them a voice. All of this is not
                        new, and it is taking different shapes and becoming more part of our daily lives so how can we start
                        bringing the industry to more ethical paths.

                        Bethany is working on co-developing a code of conduct to self-regulate as a bottom up rather than
                        top-down code of conduct. Exposing criminality is by its nature in the public interest, anything
                        that is covered by courts or exposing miscarriage of justices and that podcasters are not of the
                        hook as exposing where they are unethical is as much in the public interest as anything else. This
                        is the first time to define a public interest for a genre and what is not in the public interest
                        which includes doing it only for commercial gain, to produce material based on rumour conjecture or
                        falsehoods which is never in the public interest. Protecting the interests of children isn't
                        controversial such as naming them isn't allowed and you must not identify the names of family
                        members unless there is some link to the crime, anonymity should be extended to more victims of
                        crime than the law such as those victims of stalking or domestic violence. You should not include
                        reference to things about someone unless there is a direct link to the crime itself, or being
                        targeted because of something specific about them such as their sexuality etc. The code is still a
                        work in progress and are hoping to finalise it after working with podcasters, victims and families
                        where there will be voluntary signup and the content will be checked every two to three years and
                        will get a kite mark to prove this and audiences will see this so they will be able to seek out or
                        see that something has more ethical content.
