                    <h3>Day One</h3>
                    <h4>Crime Solving Using Future Technologies Today: AR, VR, and AI are the new “DNA” of
                        Investigations - Erika Glass, Chris Morris & Charlotte Hooper</h4>
                    <p>
                        There is Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and XR is combining the two and are technology that
                        change way we use screens for example by surgeons who use VR to practice operations and AR or VR
                        will change your life. It can also be used for reconstruction of crime scenes, you can access AR
                        or Augmented Reality with Google Glass, HoloLens, Mobile Phones, Apple Vision Pro which can
                        project eyes on screen on outside.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        AR and crime solving which offer sense of presence with evidence and crime scenes as a digital
                        overlay with TuServ by Black Marble, using it as a tool to train police and remove risk of
                        contaminating evidence. Reconstruct a crime scene as they were, preserve information as it was. Also
                        allows for extremely multi-tasking and can look at specific details of a case and pull things
                        together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        AR glasses are here. Google Glass for delivering real-time translation to field of view to shoe
                        subtitles of what has been said. Can be more connected with the people and the things around us.
                        What makes VR special, Experience = Understanding, lack of communication can mean sometimes things
                        go wrong.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cyber Helpline support victims of cybercrime and minorities are more likely to be a victim so to be
                        able to have a translation service would be valuable. AI is based on human biases and can often
                        return things that contain these. Real-time support from a bot can be useful as it comes from cyber
                        security experts and AI provides for anonymity along with needing fewer volunteers for their
                        services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        VR training allows law enforcement to experience high stress environments without being in danger.
                        Physical interactions can be simulated with vibrations and improves immersive experience and allows
                        people to react in the proper way when in the field. Can use thus to further understand what is
                        needed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        VR courtroom allows judge and jury to revisit the crime scene and to add context to the prosecution
                        or defence and allows people to know where things are in a scene and how things are layered can give
                        a more concise timeline of how things happened, distances can mean difference if it is staged, a
                        murder or a suicide.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        CrimeDoor use AR and VR to raise awareness of cases that need it, can go to app, and view AR posters
                        and bring these into the digital world and can share them on social media and save time with missing
                        persons. Can have AR/VR portal doors which allow people to visit a crime scene, AR case evidence to
                        allow people to inspect evidence and don't need AR capable device to view the materials and the
                        information can be updated and everyone with this will get this information and reduces burden on
                        families.
                    </p>
                    <p>            
                        AI and the future. AI is a big word - with chat bots it is machine learning. Five or ten years from
                        now things will be more advanced. Machine learning has downsides as are teaching it to learn all our
                        bad habits. We may have juries wearing VR goggles, may have VR trials and may change how the law is
                        applied. We've become a community and our responsibility is to not get off track, these are real
                        missing people but need to make sure to stay human. It is still the human aspect that is the most
                        important part.      
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Durham Police were using AI to do predictive policing to see where crime may happen, how are people
                        going to be over policed as there isn't the resource for this. This technology means we have to keep
                        the humanness as it enters everyone's daily life.

                    <h4>The 2005 London bombings... A deep dive - Steven Keogh, Ray Fysh & Dr Richard Shepherd and chaired by Stuart Blues</h4>
                    <p>
                        On July 7 2005 some people travelled from Leeds and met up with others at Luton and Mohammad Sidique
                        Khan, Shehzad Tanweer, Germaine Lindsay and Hasib Hussain headed to Kings Cross Station in London
                        and then went on to carry out three attacks on the tube and one on a bus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Steven Keogh was team on call to respond to terrorist incidents and they got call and watched news
                        which stated power surges initially due to the confusion, but they were told of bombs going off but
                        were getting told many things, so relocated closer so could get a better idea of what is going on
                        and found it was a bombing at three tube stations and bus. They went to Edgeware Road, all
                        casualties had been taken away and was quiet in the cordon, they needed to treat train and station
                        as a crime scene that had to be checked and took a couple of hours and first thing was to remove the
                        dead bodies. They put in a television system so could look both ends of the platform, they could see
                        a victim but couldn't positively identify them until they were brought back to the surface. This was
                        first suicide bombing in the UK, there was one body more injured than others and that was the
                        suicide bomber. They were trained to deal with Irish bombs, but this was the first incident for
                        Islamic terrorism and were not prepare for this and it was hard work and took a couple of weeks to
                        remove everything they could find.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ray Fysh became involved and made aware the morning of 7/7, police officer was coming through saying
                        there had been a bombing. He got a message to go back to the lab and had to put together a major
                        crime team, they were someone who gave advice to others at the time, as soon as something was ready
                        results would be returned. Forensic science was more of a regular thing back then but would want to
                        work, when possible, which was changed then, but said if got something in they would get the results
                        back in around 24 hours and did this every day until the back was broken of the case.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dr Richard Shepherd was on holiday at the time, they were watching and something new in place was
                        being set up which was a brand-new plan and facility and came into use at the right time. Normally
                        it was one scene, one bomb but this was four locations and was a key facility they could use.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Steve's indication of what was going on was like a bubble as the cordons were huge, they would get
                        messages but where they were was absolutely still and quiet. When families of victims came down is
                        when it became real for them, they are professional and just get on with it but that made it harder
                        and much more real.    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dr Shepherd said about dealing with the bodies from an attack of this nature. Aim is to keep as
                        professional as you can, get on with the job. When dealing with deaths normally know who that person
                        is but with mass casualties it is important to find out who the person is. They use Interpol forms
                        so can work across boundaries. They look at jewellery, contents of wallets etc and need to be
                        careful of things that may be dislodged so a wallet on body was not theirs so need to be careful.
                        Need to find out how a person has died because of this - it is more than just killer by an explosion
                        and needs to be sterile and can't have things from one place be transferred to the next.     
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Steve mentioned at the scene when looking at crater there was a credit card of one of the Bombings
                        and Ray mentioned the bombers would throw down identification and personal items and not hide their
                        identity at all, so they were identified quite quickly. 
                    </p>
                    <p>            
                        Steve mentioned impact bombing had on them, it affected them and were asked the same question if
                        they were okay, but they were okay and not affected by it, they had been a process where they had
                        seen death and everything and had built up a resilience. The police at the time were asked if anyone
                        needs counselling, and some really suffered but they were okay, these days they are asked multiple
                        times. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dr Shepherd mentioned family reception centre due to having northing being provided for families in
                        the past, was place in temporary facility where they could go in a dedicated entrance and kept
                        separate and was designed to help these families and gave them the time they needed. It is important
                        to have the time and the space.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ray mentioned the bomb factory was in Leeds and that this was identified from intelligence, they
                        knew it was the right place when they found it as the paint was blistered and vegetation outside was
                        wilted and everything was there to examined with over 1000 items with quick wins such as cans and
                        cigarettes. Build up profile of who was there, not only looking for people who did the attack but
                        those who facilitated the attacks. Device was five litre blue plastic container with black pepper a
                        d hydrogen peroxide that had been strengthened. The detonator was TATP from acetone, hydrogen
                        peroxide and citric acid and overnight get crystals and get TATP but put this into a cardboard tube
                        carefully with a light bulb filament and wired to detonator and put into a rucksack.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Steve mentioned train was removed on evening of 20th and had to sit in the train for an hour in the
                        dark, they had no sleep for two weeks and next day they got a message saying there had been more
                        attacks but this time it was a manhunt, but someone was shot by mistake - Jean Charles de Menezes.   
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ray said that the same major crime team was kept as work had been done well, he also mentioned the
                        detonators fired but the main device didn't detonate. The forensics department couldn't determine
                        composition, and their defence was it was a practical joke so would need to prove these devices were
                        intended to be viable, produce a replicated device. They contacted Kew Gardens and worked out way to
                        determine it and found out what flour was used and allowed a replica to be created and were able to
                        create a viable device and that it could have detonated if composed correctly. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Steve mentioned this changed the game from Irish terrorism and the intelligence put into things now
                        is more sophisticated and better prepared and join in with drills. When they dealt with it, they
                        were completely unprepared but if it did happen again, they would be better prepared.

                        Dr Shepherd mentioned reacting depends on people practicing and having the tent available. But need
                        to keep those skills relevant, the Manchester Arena bombing showed that they were learning things
                        they already knew. Need to know how to manage it, need to plan and try and work it out.

                    <h4>Killed Abroad / Unresolved - David Swindle, Victims Abroad & Kirsty Maxwell Charity</h4>
                    <p>
                        Every year millions of brits go abroad, as couples, groups, families but what happens when something
                        goes wrong people assume a British passport will help them but they're wrong.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        David Swindle thinks about the issues, if killed abroad you don't get help from British government
                        as they don't investigate or influence what happens in another country.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Kirsty's best friend has watched Kirsty's family struggle to get answers and was shocking to see as
                        British citizens, the way her death has been treated and continued to be treated has been awful.
                        They set up the Kirsty Maxwell charity to support others in a similar situation. Kirsty was the
                        absolute best and is missed so much and as long as they can, and they will push for answers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Kirsty's father Brian mentioned there is no mandatory process to deal with a death abroad and offers
                        no support or comfort. Kirsty's death was initially treated as a manslaughter investigation, and it
                        became clear there were massive contradictions in the investigation and didn't do this with due
                        diligence or attention. Don't know why her body ended up on floor above hers, she looked for her
                        friends why was she not allowed to leave and there were drugs and alcohol there and why was Kirsty
                        only person who was tested, the SIO mentioned that no one had took any drugs. The main person of
                        suspicion was not tested, and DNA was not taken from the men, the crime scene was not properly
                        cordoned off. CCTV was not handed over. Kirsty's friends were not interviewed, and Police refused to
                        interview them. Her clothes were lost and then the clothing itself was reported as destroyed as it
                        had been burned. No statements were taken and people in apartment opposite were not interviewed -
                        there are more questions than answers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        David mentioned asking why evidence was not accepted by the Spanish Police. Another case is a single
                        punch murder and attitude to police was to be more receptive and follow stuff up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Debbie from Victims Abroad mentioned what they found locally with Craig Mallon who was killed in
                        Lloret de Mar. His family has had problem of unreliable lawyers including duty lawyers who didn't
                        show right kind of interest. Judges give permission to investigate and if they say no then the
                        police are not allowed to investigate. With Craig have been assigned new lawyers and have an
                        investigative journalist who recently covered the case.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        David mentioned what if you don't get the support these cases are. They have had lawyers who weren't
                        right kind of lawyer. The clothes were destroyed at the post-mortem in Kirsty's case. Government
                        doesn't interfere but what if an investigation is flawed then they don't do anything. There have
                        been several documentaries and a podcast which is in Spanish. Don't have same investigative and
                        policing in another country compared to the UK. Investigation is not focusing on the victims and
                        things like the toxicology report was leaked before Kirsty's family. What can people do? Share
                        anything you can, and they will run websites and social media for these cases and is shared in
                        Spanish as well as English. Allegiances change over time and the answers lie in Benidorm and
                        Nottingham. Should have a joined-up process but the system is not there, to get involved this needs
                        to be requested and this is not likely if the investigation was not any good. Disclosure in Spain is
                        good but when you do see it there's nothing there and is a crime to criticise the police and in
                        Spain it is a judge led.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Kirsty's Dad mentioned about response from Police, they don't solve things quickly, the truth needs
                        to be forthcoming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        David mentioned it is victim centred and victim focused, and it is the voice of the victims. They
                        won't accept statements that were taken and will also say it is too long ago because it took so long
                        to get somewhere. Kirsty's case is closed pending any information comes forward.      
                    </p>
                    <p>                
                        Government not becoming involved, British consulate has a difficult role, it is difficult to see
                        where it is for particular individuals. 90 people are killed abroad and if you don't know then you
                        don't know - a lot of people come to the Kirsty Maxwell Charity for help.

                    <h3>Day Two</h3>
                    <h4>Wrongly Accused - Louise Shorter, Trevor Wilkinson, Barrister James Gregor and chaired by David Howard</h4>
                    <p>
                        CBS Reality's series Wrongly Accused has investigated some of the most flawed cases in Britain that
                        have sent innocent people down for murder, how could it have happened and how can prevent it
                        happening again. If it can happen to them, it could happen to you. There will be errors and
                        something that shouldn't happen does, is important to learn from mistakes.                        
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                        In 1975 April sent her daughter Lesley Molseed out to the shops for a loaf of bread, however when
                        she got there, she found the shop was closed and then 11-year-old Leslie disappeared and later found
                        murdered.
                    </p>                                                                                                
                    <p>
                        Trevor Wilkinson mentioned 10 years before this in the 1960s they had the Moors Murders and there
                        was a fear of this happening again.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        James Gregor mentioned there was huge pressure to find the culprit. West Yorkshire police decided to
                        move on Stephen Kiszkas their prime suspect. Jim mentioned there were a series of complaints of
                        indecent exposure and some of the girls pointed to his house but later admitted they were made up
                        but once they found him, they seemed to have plenty of reasons, but they turned out to be wrong.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        Trevor mentioned Stephen was interviewed over three days, was socially inadequate and a mummy's boy
                        and just wanted to go home and just admitted to whatever the police said. People assumed he was
                        their suspect, but sexual predators are cunning, and this suspect didn't fit the bill but this had
                        been the case with the Moors murderers as they didn't fit the bill.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        Louise Shorter talked about why someone would confess, there is nothing they can say other than that
                        so they would be allowed to go home. It has happened where people think they can go home if are
                        particular vulnerable and if say a certain thing they would be allowed to go home. There was a case
                        of group of professional adults confessed due to pressure and relentless nature it was only option
                        available to them.   
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        Key forensic evidence included seven found on victim and Stephen had ill health and required
                        testosterone injections, police assumed he had sexual urges and he had committed indecent exposure
                        within few hours, but it takes weeks for this to happen to produce sperm.            
                    </p>  
                    <p>                        
                        Louise said it was noted had a particular medical condition and asked the Doctor about it and no one
                        had interviewed him, but his discovery could have allowed the police to know that he couldn't be
                        responsible. Doctor was contained and tried to raise awareness, but it didn't come to the fore.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        Trevor said about how the Doctor was treated, appeal was failed defence and fresh evidence that was
                        already in the file. The semen sample was only taken twice and was looked at by same Doctor and
                        needed to know what effect of testosterone it was doesn't make you more aggressive unless you
                        already are aggressive. They never looked into whether Stephen could produce sperm, this is set in
                        stone and as there was sperms heads on the body but was a low count but had been exposed over three
                        nights on Moors which had reduced sperms heads and therefore the count and need to take this into
                        account. You have to match the forensic with the medical, no one could say positively.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        Jim mentioned that idea of questioning medical evidence didn't happen it was incontrovertible. There
                        was no DNA at the time. Had to do what they could do with what they had, and the case papers raised
                        question about testing of sperm count was not in minds at the time, there had already been a failed
                        appeal so when looking could be fobbed off.   
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        Louise mentioned when Stephen when waiting for trial when family had every faith in the police, this
                        is not unique to this case. They went to national archives on the case including letters to his
                        mother and would write about how the investigation would go and had faith the police would get
                        there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Louse mentioned that he was a vulnerable man that had an investigation from allegations from
                        schoolgirls that were retracted. The defence was not fit to be in court and left him vulnerable to
                        being found guilty.                        
                    </p>           
                    <p>
                        Trevor mentioned that Richard Holland the police chief believed that they thought had got the right
                        man with people wanting status and this case gets you noticed and increases chance of promotion, the
                        chief knew had got wrong man but couldn't accept it. Mayor or Rochdale had tea with them and would
                        be hard to say after that had got the wrong man.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jim mentioned was let down by defence team, the problem they faced was overwhelming available of the
                        defence of manslaughter so testosterone would mean to approach to accept a verdict of this, this
                        never happened as he wouldn't accept this and put aside all the evidence and just say was not
                        guilty. Jury should have been discharged as there was a one-day strike and one of the Jury overheard
                        the prosecution that they were trying to find them guilty and when this was reported to the Jury
                        bailiff the Judge decided that would be advice to plead guilty to manslaughter so northing was said
                        to the juror. Prosecutor Peter Taylor didn't say anything, and this shouldn't be allowed to happen.
                        Appeal was they said they never asked what should have been done and this point was dismissed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unwritten code in prison is never inform and if you see child sex offender you must hurt them or try
                        to hurt them. Stephen was seen by prisoners as a child killer and the code was enforced and was
                        tumbled down the stairs, when they read about them being released and that no one believed he hadn't
                        done it and felt bad and were in tears about what they had done to an innocent person and thought
                        about how many people are experiencing this.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Louise talked about Stephen being destroyed by the experience, when being visited in prison and
                        would speak gibberish first before could start to form proper sentences and words.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trevor mentioned Stephen was clearly broken, he was outgoing and well respected in own community,
                        was a gentle giant and was still one when he met Stefan. He wanted to get his part out and if
                        listens he understands and knew what to do to cooperate, found he was still azoospermic. He said he
                        always knew police would find out he never did it. He only retaliated once against someone in
                        prison.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jim mentioned the trial barrister Philip Glegg was pioneer to take a leap approach but was
                        surprising to see them led. There was a file with very few clues. If it was clear that sperm needed
                        to be examined, then this would have jumped out. Late disclose of thousands of pages of statement
                        and the relevant sections would be pointed out, which is ironic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trevor mentioned got a murder case on their first time and for a few weeks for six months. They
                        opened a file to examine a case thoroughly and couldn't see where it could go with new information
                        and evidence which was in the file. Twelve thousand statements were dropped on first day of trial
                        and didn't have time or money to examine this and it went very quickly to trial. They noticed that
                        the case was non forensic and didn't mention it even though it said about testosterone made him a
                        monster, but nothing went into this. There was an issue where it seemed there were no sperm heads,
                        but the file had a sperm count, but this couldn't be if there were heads. They did centrifugal test
                        to see if there were any sperm heads from the sample and the result was zero.
                    </p>
                    <p>                        
                        Stephen not long after being released he died and shortly afterwards she died. She said don't ever
                        let them forget his name and don't ever forget what happened to him. He needs to be remembered as a
                        victim of one of the most appalling miscarriage of justices ever.
                    </p>
                    <h4>The Great Train Robbery - Nick Reynolds, Chris Pickard & Jon Watt</h4>
                    <p>
                        Sixty years ago, 6.2 million pounds were stolen from a Royal Mail train, this a crime that continues
                        to fascinate including two prison breaks and those involved are household names.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Chris Pickard talked about the robbery happening in the swinging sixties and happened on a Thursday
                        and public felt we finally had our own great Robbery, even during the trial there were people on the
                        run and people would escape prison including Ronnie Biggs escaped to Brazil.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nick Reynolds mentioned that it changed from the Cheddington Mail Van Raid to Great Train Robbery
                        and even used the same font from the film. The case has affected their life as their childhood was,
                        they were on the run and thought their dad was a businessman or a spy and had different documents
                        and identities. Their dad lived a normal life as businessman and when returned to England he got
                        arrested and then spent 25 years in prison and he went to boarding school. No matter how
                        sophisticated a criminal that crime doesn't pay but during the 90s it changed the robbers to have
                        celebrity status.

                    <p>
                        Nick mentioned about the robbery that his father was not unknown to the law as there had been a raid
                        at an airport and already had two convictions so was known by the old bill at the time. Their dad
                        was a leader of a South London gang and there was another gang wanting to do a raid and tried to do
                        a robbery using the emergency break but weren't able to stop the train where they wanted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nick mentioned was a gang of experienced thieves and were approached about train from London to
                        Glasgow that carried a lot of mail but also a lot of money. They were looking ahead to what was
                        next, what was at the end of the road or what was at the end of the track in this case. They worked
                        out train of gold would be too hard as gold was too heavy, advanced technology made banks and safes
                        much more secure, you didn't hold up a bank you got it in transit, like on a train and looked in to
                        how to stop the train.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Chris mentioned they were told about how much was on the train, which was around 1 million, but it
                        turned out to be better around 2 million.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nick mentioned how to stop a train was to put glove over green light and battery on the red light,
                        there was over 80 people on the train so needed to plan accordingly. It needed to be stopped near
                        London, as it was going along the line was picking up more money and only had it all 30 minutes
                        before it was robbed.
                    </p>
                    <p>                       
                        Chris mentioned they had to find places where to stop it and how to uncouple it to leave most of the
                        people behind and to do this as quickly s possible, the crew would expect it to stop but not for too
                        long. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nick mentioned there was not supposed to be any violence as got a higher tariff and was deeply
                        regretted the injury to Mills. It went largely to plan and didn't leave any evidence at all. They
                        were supposed to put arms around driver, and passed along to a new person and instead of grabbing
                        them he wacked on the head and cut himself on the dash but wasn't able to say as was threatened with
                        losing their pension.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Chris mentioned they were to go to a farm with supplies for a couple of weeks. They wanted to
                        initially drive to London but would dress up as an army convoy and wanted to count the money in
                        front of each other, then separate it into equal amounts. The highest value note was a £10 note of
                        2.6 million pounds 15 million pounds today. They were playing monopoly with real money, it moved to the 
                        flying squad and became more serious.
                    </p>      
                    <p>
                        Nick mentioned they were listening on police radio and heard were in a 30-mile radius, someone was
                        meant to take all the evidence of sacks and paper around notes but had been picked up by police on a
                        separate matter. Someone nearby heard about Robbery and saw vehicles at farm and informed the police
                        but took a couple of days to get there due to number of calls. His dad's fingerprints were found on
                        allegedly sauce bottle but there was also case of paint being found and two people were fitted up by
                        the police. They did a deal with some of them if the money was returned. There was one who said
                        nothing to do with them then their fingerprint was found on a bath rail that had been wiped down.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nine people had been arrested and Nick's dad wasn't and thought it would die down after six months
                        but after eight and got a flight to Belgium and then to Mexico where he joined his dad. There was a
                        few that had no evidence linking them to the train, only to the farm and his uncle had fingerprints
                        found on monopoly board but those could have been at any time. It was described as a violent
                        Robbery, Nick said and got 30 years which is five years more than murder. It was a big mistake, and
                        it turned the robbers into martyrs as it was too long a sentence for them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Chris mentioned that someone being shot was six years, but thirty years was fine six months later
                        for Robbery by the same judge.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nick mentioned there was no parole and when it was mentioned it was thirty years and was assumed to
                        be all together not each by one person.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Chris spoke about a mystery man with postal services. One of the key people was Brian Field who was
                        lawyer who got information about the train coming down. It could be more than one person, whoever it
                        was it made the police follow every one of the workers on the train who had connections to Ireland.
                        This person said how much money was on the train, this person told them to hold back a day and knew
                        what would go on that day, could be post office or a railway worker. They were told to wait for 24
                        hours and then next day were told to go then.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nick mentioned was given a name of someone who worked in railway and had a brother who was criminal.
                        There were three who got away and there was a driver who has not been tracked down and was an old
                        train driver.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Chris mentioned about Ronnie Biggs escape, he didn't have connections but was treated well by
                        prisoners and they said he must escape with rope ladders and van. He didn't even have a passport and
                        escaped to Australia and there was a story there and featured photos of him and he had to disappear
                        and decided to go to Rio de Janeiro. He was never discovered and had made a deal with Daily Express,
                        and it was them who told the police. Ronnie knew if he became a burden he would come back, and they
                        would welcome them back.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nick was flown out with his father by Rupert Murdoch to return Ronnie Biggs to the UK from Brazil,
                        who made money by having people come and listen to stories but had three strokes so couldn't do it
                        anymore.  
                    </p>
                    <h4>Mass Shooters - Sarah Feris & Katherine Schweit</h4>
                    <p>
                        Sarah Feris is a true crime podcaster with three podcasts with one with Katherine who headed up FBI
                        active shooter programme.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Katherine Schweit was with the FBI for 20 years and headed up program trying to resolve active
                        shootings. They were "voluntold" to work on team with then Vice President Biden when Sandy Hook Massacre
                        happened and then they retired and now consult on how to reduce violence.
                    </p>
                    <p>                   
                        Katherine said they never name the shooter but if subscribe then if there is one, they will put
                        together a podcast. They talk about the shooting and then the signs the shooter gave that were
                        missed, what the signs are and how can we stop someone on pathway to violence. As they worked in
                        area you don't get their option but speak to those who know the most about these issues. One of
                        their episodes is someone who talked a gun out of someone's hand, they also talk about cases they
                        were involved in along with others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sarah said they do an episode every week, they will be covering myths and misinformation about mass
                        shootings. Have asked for questions. Addressing a couple of elephants in the rooms, are mass
                        shootings just a US problem?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Katherine says countries of highest proportion of guns have the most shootings. US has federal,
                        state and county laws so can't just pass a law like in the UK to make changes or Canada or New
                        Zealand. They have the most, but others also have them. Mass shootings aren't strictly defined, they
                        did the first research and is when someone is attempting to kill people in a crowded space but
                        exclude gang and drug warfare along with murder / suicides. Every researcher had their own criteria,
                        most countries don't have a definition. It is a gravity situation so if have fifteen people injured
                        and one killed that is still a mass shooting but that can be different elsewhere.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sarah said that they do global shootings including a couple in New Zealand and there were some
                        changes but that's not always possible including in the United States.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Katherine says that research by FBI and secret service on what to look for, normal people are five
                        times more likely to see this than a law enforcement so are looking for changes in behaviour so if
                        they go shooting on weekends but suddenly someone starts shooting in the back yard - a change of
                        behaviour. Most shooters are male and if they dress differently than before. That's what you're
                        looking for is changes in behaviour, giving away their possessions for example. During investigation
                        they will work backwards and will find out they gave something away as they don't need it before.
                        Change in typical behaviour can be seen by friends or schoolmates. 92 percent of people will say a
                        shooter will become one before it happens. A kid was called to counsellor's office due to some signs
                        and they later killed four people and the parents are going to go on trial for involuntarily
                        manslaughter which can be 20 years as the change in behaviour was so bad.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sarah mentioned were told not to do Sandy Hook as first episode they did. They had some questions
                        the killer put blackout blinds on their window, if you saw this what would you do? You wouldn't do
                        anything.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Katherine has taken calls at last minute when something is going on or something seems weird, when
                        you tell someone, you're taking it off your shoulders. Someone isn't going to be arrested for having
                        blackout curtains, but they may enquire, trust your instincts and just call and take that burden of
                        your shoulders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sarah mentioned it may be the last piece of the puzzle. Katherine said that there could be a phone
                        call, they even tricked someone to sign something to get a handwriting sample to be sure and got
                        search warrant and was able to prove they were writing letters saying it was anthrax and call in
                        bomb threats, he wasn't a nice guy and it had to be tricked. Sarah raised question about difference
                        between automatic and semi-automatic. Automatic fires until you take finger off travel,
                        semi-automatic is where it can be fired each trigger pull.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Katherine spoke about how to talk about guns with anyone, in US gun laws are complicated, people
                        don't know facts and don't want to talk about it, are either for or against guns but it is very hard
                        to have these conversations and then only ask if for or against guns. Katherine would ask for police
                        reports but wouldn't get much if a shooter is dead, they still need to look into it even if the
                        shooter is dead. They have had after actions on how to prevent them, this is purpose of
                        investigation to help prevent future ones.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Katherine mentioned Missouri passed a second amendment preservation act which makes it difficult to
                        do gun laws. Most people in the US live in urban locations on one side of politics, state
                        governments are for the other side of this. This can be back and forth, as there is an effort to do
                        something then may pass something that says that the second amendment rules. Katherine spoke about
                        dealing with cases on an emotional level, they were a single parent when joining FBI, but they could
                        go home and spent time with kids and that helped. They made a choice to not work on things they
                        can't unsee. They do a lot of meditation and hiking as need to get out and get away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Katherine was asked about the case in Plymouth where behaviour was reported, and nothing happened.
                        There's nothing wrong with getting in good trouble, if nothing is done you keep reporting it, call
                        different people. Katherine mentioned thing about making a call, you want to know what happened,
                        have to be confident that you are adding knowledge about an individual, you want to be one of the
                        calls even if something happens. Criminals are stupid in so many ways, in US have right to say
                        whatever you want with the first amendment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sarah mentioned don't just call the police and call once or leave an anonymous tip, there is even an
                        international one for the FBI which is passed on, you won't get the actual answer, they won't call
                        you back they will spend that resource forward.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        Katherine spoke about what preparation are being made, tiny fraction of school children are affected
                        by mass shootings. Children are six times safer in schools than at home. It is not bad to harden
                        your target, they are not securing schools with bulletproof glass or magnetometers but get a
                        counsellor. Once thing they tell them is to lock the doors, shooters are looking for something
                        convenient. It isn't a question of being the fastest person being chased by a bear, people think
                        everyone with a gun is looking for somewhere to shoot up. School shootings are most often carried
                        out by current or recent students.

                    <p>
                        Charlotte Hooper spoke about the Cyber Helpline being created as not enough was being done to help
                        victims of cybercrime. They are the UK infosec community coming together to fill in support for

                        Delmelza Reaver said as technology advances so does the complexity of cybercrime further blurring
                        lines between online and offline crime. Crimes using tech advancements include domestic abuse,
                        stalking and harassment, grooming and others.

                        Charlotte mentioned what is cybercrime, most of this is financial crime including economic abuse by
                        partner. Can have multiple vectors for cybercrime and can include cyberstalking and harassment.

                        Charlotte spoke about Cybercrime and Violent Crime includes Cyber Homicide with first case in 1996
                        when arranged to meet in person for what is termed consensual homicide. 1987 marked first Internet
                        serial killer and in 2007 have been killers who found victims on Craigslist, also then there was
                        cyberstalking including a website which slandered her and resulted in murder of her and friend. In
                        2016 there was an honour killing about content that was being posted online. Accessibility of tech
                        makes it easy to find victims and to find people to support this.

                        Delmeza spoke about domestic homicide abuse, there age months of abusive texts and were generally of
                        a threatening nature but thought they would get bored and give up if they ignored them. They were
                        recorded and felt had to stay in relationship and escalation tends to occur and they sought support
                        from their parents and connected with the police, but when she spoke to officers told them to block
                        him but none of these interventions stopped this, was a key indicator of type of abuse and led to
                        concern of fear by parents and when they went on holiday gave photos to neighbours and told them to
                        call police if the person turned up. Within days of these actions, it escalated by posts on social
                        media and further attempted contact by police with no response. Rosemary and parents contacted
                        police and they failed to consider the abuse as it was technological in nature.

                        Charlotte spoke about technology role in abuse to escape a controlling husband, stalking is like a slow
                        murder and is a terrible experience and one someone felt they never could escape. They approached
                        Cyber Helpline and mentioned hearing cat noises from car, but had found cameras in apartment, but he
                        had set up sat nav to make a cat noise when passed location and adding things to allow them to track
                        their car. There are means to track children that can be used maliciously.

                        Delmeza spoke about IoT where have thermostats, locks or other things connected to the Internet and
                        often won't consider them and these can be used and cause significant distress such we putting
                        heating on in summer or running up bills. There are locks can set perimeters so if they leave the
                        home all the doors are locked and can cause significant concerns and behaviour. Is a key concern to
                        have these devices you might not consider.

                        Charlotte spoke about tech role in abuse, someone feared that a catfish would come and keep one hand
                        on phone and other on a baseball bat about a stalker who would pose as a family member or friend and
                        collect intimate pictures and send them to their place of employment and would contact friends and
                        families pretending to be them and destroyed many relationships, although it never turned physical
                        they feared this. With physical stalking you know where they are but with digital stalking you never
                        know where they are.

                        Sexual crimes can be against online sex workers which can be to tell others about their Jon and Only
                        Fans can be pressure to create content they wouldn't want to. There is also revenge porn for images
                        of people obtained without their consent and can lead to violent crimes being performed against
                        them. There can be sexual assault against people to create content or are coerced to create content
                        they would not normally.

                        With rise and accessibility on tech in crime such as AI and creation of deep fakes and can be used
                        to create voice notes of people and be used to create calls from people their daughter about being
                        held hostage but just before she paid daughter walked in door. Availability and cost if AI is lower
                        with tools like ChatGPT which can be used by anyone. Matter of playing catchup with what criminals
                        are using.

                    <p>
                        Delmelza spoke about policies the police are creating and efforts to stay on top of this. Cybercrime
                        requires curiosity and interest to look further. Getting a place where can innovate services will
                        take some time.

                        Charlotte talked about who is responsible for change including social media, police, government with
                        safe settings enforced by default, standardised and improved responses updated legislation, identity
                        verification, training, and education. Overall need collaboration and communication. In an ideal
                        world the Cyber Helpline wouldn't need to exist. Shouldn't have to worry about technology.

                    <p>
                        Charlotte spoke about how you can help, educate those around you, become digital activist, campaign,
