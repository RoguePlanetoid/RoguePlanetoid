                    <h3>Welcome - Ashleigh King</h3>
                    <p>
                        Ashleigh thanked everyone for coming along and talked about launching her new podcasting course
                        with support of Creative UK with lots of progress and challenges. These workshops are about specific 
                        problems people have including brand, courage and unlocking your voice with four speakers to hear 
                        about content, community and collaboration.

                    <h3>Levelling up your podcast with video - Joel Lowson</h3>
                    <p>
                        Ashleigh met Joel in 2009 and has seen him grow and what has only got better is his attention to
                        detail and quality of his work and runs his own business Joel Lowson Photography. Will be talking
                        about levelling up your podcast to help increase engagement online. 26% of podcast consumers say
                        they prefer watching videos over listening ang watching videos is preferred in particular by podcast
                        newcomers. People are usually multi-tasking when listening to a podcast like driving the car so
                        can't watch a video there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        YouTube is the biggest podcast platform in the United States and most people watch and listen to
                        podcasts there compared to Spotify and Apple with Spotify transitioning to video podcasts. YouTube
                        is the biggest entertainment search engine in the world, when searching the first thing to come up
                        is videos, you can search by videos or short form videos. If you have an audio only podcast people
                        aren't searching for you on YouTube. A lot of podcast platforms don't have comments or
                        recommendations on shows, and you can't have paid subscribers on most platforms but can on YouTube
                        where it is all integrated into one space.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Benefits of video is increased accessibility which allows you attract an audience you may be missing
                        by having audio only. In terms of how we consume content most people prefer to watch videos online
                        but lots of people don't utilise this, so adding video is another element to your podcast and make
                        it look, seem and feel different to other podcasts. If just talking to someone from a visual
                        standpoint it won't stand out, there are formats and schedules to shows on the TV that you could
                        emulate. He listens to a true crime podcast which is audio only but when talking about certain
                        things on the video podcast they show a picture of this which helps people interact with your
                        content better and help them truly engage as with video you have someone's full attention. You get a
                        vibe meeting someone face to face so video can allow you to build on this and you can get increased
                        monetisation opportunities to advertise people's products in your video podcast. You can have your
                        own merch and if people see it all the time, they may think it is cool and want to buy it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The platforms are set up as a pay to win setup on platforms such as Spotify where if browse for
                        podcasts they are well known ones. Short form video is everywhere, and LinkedIn has just introduced
                        this. There are thousands of people discovering podcasts every day on social media. To cut a long
                        story short, Steven Bartlett has changed the game, it is not just about pulling a clip from a
                        podcast, Steven takes highlights with an emotional impact and adds music, and a Steven Bartlett
                        trailer is something they are asked for. You could have the funniest, most emotional clip or the
                        most interesting facts, does it have a hook is it the most controversial take which can create
                        engagement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Videos are important for your podcast, but you don't need a video podcast, if you're doing a
                        business podcast post videos on LinkedIn or on Pinterest for arts and crafting podcasts. How long
                        should shorts be is most people say under sixty seconds, but this is not necessarily true, it is as
                        long as people are engaged but might not be to finish a point if you want to have them come to your
                        podcast to hear the rest. You can use audiograms where turn waveform of podcast into a visual
                        component which will dance around as someone talks and you need to add captions as if people can't
                        hear too well a dancing waveform won't help them and when people watch short form videos they listen
                        with their sound off, so if there is no sound or visual component they will scroll past. When
                        editing you can use something like Riverside Magic clips which can add captions, you don't have to
                        be an editing whiz to do this, what is important is putting this stuff out in the first place and
                        reminding people who you are.
                    </p>

                        Trying to fit in, your aspect ratio is the width of the image divided by the height so a screen
                        would be 16:9 but social media videos are 9:16 so will be cropping video accordingly, there is also
                        4:5 which was used on social media but the main aim is to fill as much as possible, so you have
                        someone's full time and dedication even if it is just for a few seconds. Where should you be is the
                        composition with the rule of thirds so can't both sit in the centre if doing a video podcast so are
                        evenly spaced apart which helps for social media so need to consider where the UI of the social
                        media will appear such as not having things to the far right or bottom but have captions more
                        centrally and have eye level two-thirds of the way up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pros of video is discoverability and accessibility where captions can be easily translated to other
                        languages so people who speak those languages can enjoy your podcast. You can have a broader
                        audience or appeal to people who only watch a video, and it helps trust and credibility along with
                        monetisation opportunities. Video is more expensive with more setup time with more complex editing,
                        you might need to buy cameras, lighting or props or for a business podcast my have to dress more
                        smartly. There is a technical challenge such as more cameras or more things can go wrong, could
                        forget to press record, a battery could fail or other potential problems so to offset this may need
                        to hire crew so northing can go wrong but this increases cost. Knowledge gap with cameras including
                        shutter speed, framerate and more, but you can just use your phone especially if using this only for
                        social media.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Someone asked about being on Riverside as a guest and has some experience of basic podcasting with their
                        phone and Audacity, so if using Riverside so may have a guest in another country so is it still
                        worth doing a video podcast? It is worth doing this as Riverside will record things locally so if
                        there is a problem it will record everything from their side and from your side. If you want to
                        speak to guests around the world as not worth doing a big production set when the guest is not in
                        that, so could have something like a Zoom call but can check out Riverside on how to do this
                        properly and there are different formats for social media so you could have one person on the top
                        and the other and the bottom and you could edit within the software so keeps everything simple and
                        under one roof, traditionally would have to record everything separately which needs to be
                        synchronised which is too much for people to deal with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Someone else mentioned that they are going to be using their own studio in the office, but their IT is stringent so won't
                        allow them to use Riverside. Some people do have lower quality content works fine as long as the
                        message you are providing good content as content is the most important thing. You could also record
                        in Teams, and you could also connect this with OBS, you could record in high quality with a mixer
                        locally so if there is a connection issue can record from this. They did want to use OBS but tried a
                        multi camera setup but could use the mixer to act as a virtual camera with OBS and this works well
                        and there are different methods of doing things such as with Zoom.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes when people watch videos and can see people who is talking or listening, so can be
                        distracting that they aren't listening enough or distracted or nodding along too much. You need to
                        presume that you are on camera, when they work in their commercial business for a promotional video
                        where they want to do a two-person video which they will only do if you can bounce off each other,
                        can't have one person take the reins and the other just sit there and do nothing, so need to make
                        sure people are aware and practise it. You could also use multi cameras with a wide for both people
                        and one for each person and when someone is talking then you can just cut to the person who is
                        talking, so if just on a lower budget can maybe cut out things or get people to be relaxed or
                        comfortable. When inviting people on a podcast they may be more reserved. Riverside can cut to the
                        person who is talking, there will be video for both parties along with a combined mix which will cut
                        between both people but can also edit between the separate videos. Where people may get distracted
                        where people forget they are being recorded so people can see your facial expressions where you see
                        someone drifting away or thinking so to tackle this have briefing notes with what to talk about it
                        and keep questions short, so they aren't long monologues, so people won't get distracted. When using
                        Riverside close down all other applications on your laptop so if have other applications on this
                        will drain resources and will have connectivity issues and it is also possible to get distracted if
                        have tabs open. Can mitigate distractions and orchestrate things so you can cut our awkwardness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ability to connect with people all over the world so on studio podcast people come in and record in
                        the studio and are there in person so there are stories around the world might be missing out on so
                        could do things online with Riverside to get more people on the podcast. You might not know people
                        in other country, you don't know who your story may touch and people may have their own connections
                        and people all over the world may listen to your podcast who are listening and come back so if doing
                        something online it opens up more possibilities for who you can have on your podcast. There is
                        content in other parts of the world and other content creators from there and there can be a
                        different element for other cultures and if can make something that is easiest to translate for
                        other people, for Brazil they are the third biggest country for podcasts but just know Portugues,
                        you don't have to have a video element you could have your brand logo and a audiogram and people can
                        caption it in their language and have it in that different format they can access. Riverside does
                        caption your content, it is a great platform that does most of what you need, but you can also edit
                        it so with AI it is not perfect but does save a lot of time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Issues someone has when playing around on TikTok they get double captions and then they edit them
                        and have this on social clips where some platforms have an automatic captions features, so this may
                        be something they need to turn off as may be an accessibility mode that can be switched off on
                        TikTok if they have the captions that has been added on Riverside.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For getting started when recording on phone what are top tips what you need, what to recommend for
                        this? Tripod is a definite and the main standpoint is composition to have it at a good eye level for
                        people to engage with you, so don't put on the floor. You want to make sure the level of the phone
                        is correct where tripod is a good place to start, phone is good at adjusting to light but if going
                        out and about can ignore lighting and most places won't approve of people plugging in lights but if
                        doing things at home or though Riverside on laptop then make sure don't have harsh shadows and light
                        is on the subjects, you could get a light and point it at you or have window light shine behind you
                        but there is a problem that this light changes from really bright to really dark so studios will
                        often have no windows so they can control the light. When getting lights get something that is
                        dimmable, as can have too much light, get something which is bicolour where can adjust the white
                        balance, so think about light outside winter is bluish and summer is orange, so bicolour allows you
                        to adjust things from blue to orange and match environment better so that the whites look white. The
                        most important thing is a good quality microphone, if recording onto laptop get a USB microphone, if
                        going out and about get a lapel mic you can connect to your phone.

                        How do you identify your clients and develop products that serve your community, with what they have
                        learned and provide common ground that meet other needs, how do you identify your clients. You may
                        have listeners and audience who you know their age, hobbies and other essential information you need
                        to gather before you start on merchandise. If you are creating a customer profile this will help
                        identify their needs, wants and problems you want to solve so if a podcast about managing finance,
                        then they may want some kind of financial management tool which could be downloadable and free or
                        something you develop that people buy in.

                        Problems you can help an audience solve, such as staking your place in a music community, you build
                        your fan credentials about how much knowledge you have of a band but breaking down idea you have to
                        be someone who knows the most, been to many gigs but instead making an inclusive space of enjoying
                        and not demonstrating dedication. Building healthier habits which is linked with coaching to see
                        where someone is now and how they can feel better about themselves and looking at their everyday
                        life and the small steps they can make and help them learn what they need to do and the steps to get
                        them there, could be a downloadable tool to help form better habits and relationships with an app
                        you could bring that community onto.

                        Look at what other podcasts already produce, promotional products or products that you sell, could
                        have giveaways like the bottles for One Square Law for those guests who spend their time on the
                        podcast. Draw inspiration but don't copy, do something that is unique to you and something that it
                        suited to your niche and your business. Steven Bartlett is very driven and has a corporate bundle
                        with The 1% Diary which is to change 1% of your habits and has volume discounts which shows there
                        are companies buying this to help their employees or also has conversation cards as people struggle
                        with starting conversations and people's soft skills are being reduced so the challenge we have is
                        how young people will communicate effectively as they are living slightly isolated lives. Steven
                        Bartlett's podcast is heavily monetised but also he is doing it from a perspective of finding
                        businesses to invest in but has also had issues where he hasn't been challenging his guests, so when
                        you create something you need to back up the evidence, do you hold podcasts to the same journalistic
                        standard as something like the BBC but he does have a duty of care and responsibility.

                        Wondery Shop has merchandise for different podcasts with print on demand where products are more
                        expensive, so margins are smaller, if choosing to print on demand choose carefully and your creative
                        IP is protected and is sustainable at the core, the one they use is Prodigy but need to look at your
                        margins and markup as they are expensive to produce. Chris and Rosie Ramsey have their own
                        merchandise and with What's you Beef they were able to craft a variety of products that felt their
                        audience feel part of something which demonstrates having a customer profile is important for
                        products. Example products that are best sellers include mugs, but also hats are a good idea as they
                        are one size, key rings, pin badges, bookmarks are a good one if have a book community and you can
                        put something visual on one side and text on the other. Pin badges are a good example such as for
                        TEDx or a heart pin which are made in Birmingham, you could use a phrase that people feel they are
                        part of a club. Mugs are good for people who work from home where people can tag your company in
                        photos of them holding it. Bags are underestimated with the humble tote bag where with I Love North
                        Shields bag where people have taken photos of themselves out and about, they could be used to
                        promote your podcast and could have a QR code that people could scan and go direct to your podcast.
                        Audience profiling and learning from social media, test a product with a mock up to show what you
                        are creating and get preorders to minimise your financial risk.

                        Can your products become part of your marketing strategy, what would your call to action be to
                        deliver on your return on investment. What would your call to action be to deliver your return on
                        investment? Could have a few items for people to have and or have print on demand for a given period
                        and make people interested in your products in the first place, have influencer and exclusive
                        limited-edition high-quality merchandise where have the right people wearing them and like the idea
                        of keeping things local. There are some print on demand companies in the North East, it is a good
                        marketing strategy to keep things local. You could have "take a photo and tag us", people from North
                        Shields love where they live and there is an 800 year celebration, tap into an emotional reason why
                        someone would take a photo and tag you such as exclusivity feeling or may be doing inclusivity such
                        as women's safety at gigs where can galvanise people to come together and become part of a group or
                        create a pin badge for men who can say they are part of that community or are a safe space.

                        Think about creating things that have purpose and meaning, we don't need any more things people will
                        throw away. What is your story and what is the story you want to tell, is the product that is
                        designed or created going to be one that people say they want that. Do they share your values and
                        unite your audience, what else can you share with your product as there could be an artist or
                        community interest group you could work with. Also, something carefully thought through is something
                        better than something with your logo on and always encourage to make products that are
                        #MadeToLastNotForLandfill is it part of your values. What next steps to take include researching
                        audience and thinking about products.

                    <p>
                        Daps talked about growing his show and how he is consistently putting out content week after week and
                        is good to see how people can improve over time and have the courage to be consistent. Daps is
                        talked about growing a community in podcasting, anything more than five friends is being part of a
                        community and may be part of a bigger community. When talking about growing a community is to ask
                        what is the hardest challenge, but it is finding people who care about what you do, why is it harder
                        to find people on social media.

                    <p>
                        Daps started their podcast five years ago and not many people were listening but strongly believed
                        that there were things they needed to talk about that people needed to hear so needed to be clear
                        about who will listen to this podcast. They moved over to Ireland from Nigeria and then to the UK
                        and thought about why would people care for what they say, why would people care as they're not from
                        here, they used to think that a lot but thankfully they don't anymore. Everyone in the room has a
                        story or knows someone who has a story, podcasting is storytelling, so how well can you tell or
                        articulate a story.

                        He started off being shy but had to get over that, they remember their first few views and now
                        their first thousand and now can get that for one piece of content. You can't be afraid of being
                        consistent and taking your content on social media consistently, it has to be that you show up every
                        single time and there are things that they have done that have made their podcast successful.
                        They learned how to play the piano and when they moved to Newcastle they got into music and what
                        they felt, and their podcast was about the pain points of being a musician in the North East. They
                        were talking about people getting real jobs as music wasn't paying and they got people to listen
                        week after week after week. When they started, they didn't have a camera but they knew before they
                        got into it that video was an important thing, listening was important, but video is different when
                        they can see your reactions and inflections people love that, they can take the audio and video and
                        form a connection. They had a guest show up with their own camera but didn't have that and didn't
                        know how to edit but figured it out and put their episode out, you can have multiple cameras now,
                        but everyone has a beginning, most phones film in 4K.

                        When want to create community have to talk consistently about what you want to talk about it, when
                        going to events talked about their podcast. If you do multiple things but you need to learn talking
                        about the thing you are most passionate about, as this is the thing you want to grow the most, if
                        you don't talk about your podcast enough then it will be very challenging to grow your podcast.
                        Every gig they went to they talked about their podcast, they remember the days of first thousand
                        views and had 80k views on something on Instagram where they name dropped someone, they hadn't met
                        but how they were fascinated about their journey and being proud of the religion they were and that
                        artist saw it and reposted. They remember their first 100k and 200k on TikTok, they hadn't taken
                        YouTube Shorts seriously but had met another YouTuber in the North East who makes their living from
                        being on YouTube and asked them how they built that following and it was to care more about YouTube
                        Shorts to take long form content and post it there. They were only getting a few hundred views on
                        YouTube but getting thousands on Instagram but decided to go back and post some short videos on
                        YouTube Shorts and found a few hundred views from just that, so take advantage of your social media
                        and short form content and are always talking about your podcast with your community and that's how
                        you grow a community.

                        He started to make his hats a year and a half ago as was about wearing something they wanted to wear and
                        wanted to create a channel where people came to buy something, they said they had 20 hats and is
                        first come first served or get T-shirts but can do whatever you want but have something you can show
                        people. They wear their merch all the time and have people who have bought some and the best
                        complement about their podcast has been their brand being consistent over the years, which is all
                        done on Canva, so think about what would look well as a brand and translate well. The guests on your
                        show matter, every guest you have has a network or community as well and you can leverage that
                        massively, if you actually do you research you can find ways to attract that community over to you,
                        it isn't the case of having a guest on and all the rest follows. If you haven't done your proper
                        research such as not talking about things that are relevant to them then are wasting their time, you
                        need to be thinking about why certain videos did well or what guests who did well what are they
                        doing consistently. They didn't have a plan initially but now are intentional including their
                        thumbnails now.

                        In terms on YouTube the United States is five years ahead of the UK, but in the North East we are a
                        couple of years behind this and apart for a couple of podcasts none of the popular ones are in the
                        North East. Something that happened for a long time was thinking of their podcast being just from
                        the North East, can someone somewhere else in the world, what would they think about it, you need to
                        think globally about a podcast and what will happen from intro, description, and thumbnail then
                        everything is going to be on par, don't just think North East but think globally, you need to be
                        global people and be international.

                        music but learned so it never affected them, so be humble and don't pay attention to it, especially
                        there will be haters. There is that fear of success, it is about uplifting communities.
                        The biggest thing they wish they knew was to believe in themselves from the get-go, it was like can
                        this be a thing and thinking why should anyone listen to this thing but don't know where that comes
                        from, so knowing what they know now was to go back and say do it, no one cares and be impactful. If
                        you content is authentically good people will come, it starts with you.

                        How do you self-motivate, were there occasions where they wanted to give up, how to you pick
                        yourself up? Daps wanted to quit so many times, so had to stop thinking about the podcast as a talk
                        show but instead as a movement, you are starting a movement, if you don't want to do this then don't
                        start a podcast, you will build an audience who appreciate them, to represent those people who don't
                        want to be on camera and share their voice. Think about it as being responsible for the people you
                        are doing the show for, might have someone in the community reach out. One of the things was people
                        wanting to listen to them in prison, want to do it for people who have turned their lives around and
                        want to help others.

                    <p>
                        It is not just about yourself it is altruistic and it is about the bigger picture, they had went
                        online and looked how to start a podcast as were the biggest fan of podcasts growing up, they
                        listened to audio only content starting with the Ricky Gervais show and realised that talk shows are
                        becoming a big thing so became a fan of listening which informed the person they wanted to become
                        and listened well and knew what it took to make a podcast very well. There are so many people you
                        can reach or impact.

                        Building your community and own spaces, social media channels and collaborating with guests. What is
                        their view on going to other like-minded communities, there has to be a reason for this, or
                        connection to this. A lot of the things we feel, what is too much really, but what feels right for
                        you is enough, what is your capacity and are you comfortable with your capacity. The first year or
                        two they tried everything, they had done Standup Comedy in Prohibition bar. If posting to other
                        people's communities and aren't getting much engagement, then it might not be the right place. Video
                        format is so important, and they were lucky enough to go to The Podcast Show in London this year and
                        it was incredible and everyone was saying the same thing "video, video, video, video" and tightening
                        formats is more important and things are changing year on year, pay more attention on what you put
                        out there and your massaging. Think about your hook, what is in the first five seconds you will say
                        will take everyone's attention and it might not be initially that exponential growth.

                        Daps have their own YouTube channel with 164 videos and 864 subscribers but in the last month have had
                        10,000 views so are they monetised, so what kind of income could they expect. They are not monetised
                        yet and there is a partner programme where have to have 4,000 watch hours from main videos that
                        needs to be more than 10 minutes long and need 1,000 subscribers but they have their 4,000 watch
                        hours and got this in about a year. Everything from 2024 onwards has been much better and came from
                        a year without spending anything on ads with just organic growth, you can see what your watch time
                        is, why are people not watching your content. There are going to be people who want to watch your
                        content, and the money will come. It is about £1 per thousand views when are monetised but the bulk
                        of the money comes from sponsored ads and when get to bigger subscriber numbers then bigger brands
                        will reach out, if want to get paid from views then can go on TikTok but need to have people
                        following you as well as views. There is still a lot of work to get monetised. They did have a US
                        sponsor in Silicon Valley sent them some drinks and paid them and a year later they liked the
                        sponsored videos and wanted to do more with them but none of this sponsorship came from the UK, the
                        UK brands that have sponsored them are local brands such as free clothes from a local retailer or
                        free food from places but is not the kind of sponsorship that is £1,000 per month. When they
                        realised their podcast editing skills were good enough then they could make money from it no matter
                        where your client is from and there will be someone who doesn't care about editing.

                    <h3>Fireside Chat with Dawn Young hosted by Ashleigh King</h3>
                    <p>
                        Ashleigh has known Dawn for a while and as even spoke at a few of her Podcast Paddock event.
                        Dawn started Scottish Murders which is a podcast about those who have been murdered in Scotland
                        although they did try and cover cases outwith Scotland but those were less popular. Dawn prefers to
                        do older cases, as there are families of victims around for newer cases, for those older cases for
                        research they use the British Newspaper Archive with hundreds of tabs open, so they note everything
                        down and type it out and manually write it out and tell the victim's story which is important to
                        them. It is from the victim's perspective, and they are reclaiming their identities and have the
                        victims have attention.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dawm was at the The Podcast Show in London and was being recognised for their voice from someone who said 
                        their girlfriend listened to the podcast when they slept at night. Dawn mentioned that it was great to be 
                        part of a community online with those from the United States and in the UK with Crimecon where people 
                        are friendly and they have given away things like torches and pens. People do stop doing their podcast 
                        with true  crime and do take breaks with their podcast, so being consistent is important and need to have a 
                        budget for time, energy and resources.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They have started on Patreon, when they started, they started a merch store, built community, they
                        did buy me a coffee right from the start but they don't promote it as find it difficult and don't
                        actively promote it but it is there but do mention it in an off-hand way. People just want to
                        support you so many in true crime will just have bonus episodes so many out there will support and
                        can do shoutouts to those supporting her on Patreon who want to support them and don't necessarily
                        have to have anything in return. You could offer something digital like Scottish Murders wallpaper
                        that is on their phone or shoutouts on the podcast. Set up merch store with own graphics with own
                        intellectual property but it isn't for making money, it was just something to have in place for
                        people who want it and see what works and what doesn't.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What would she do differently? Dawn said that it would be to focus more on the Patreon and nurture that community as
                        they are paying every month and do more for that community. When people do join Patreon they do get
                        a shout out on the podcast. Anyone who asks about doing a topic for an episode get a shout out on
                        the podcast.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dawn did do all the writing and editing at first but got someone else to do the editing and
                        initially it started out with Dawn and her sister. They listened to Crime Junkie initially so that's
                        what they wanted to do, it didn't work and wasn't quite as focused so made the decision to do it
                        themselves but was worried as people were used to that style and did lose a few listeners but gained
                        a few but it was more respectful and sensitive and to change and adapt.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dawn helped cofound Cluarantonn which is about giving back and be able to ask anything, as they would have loved to have
                        someone to ask all their questions so wanted to be that person. The goal has been to find people
                        like that but have often found those wanting business podcasts instead, but it is still ongoing.
                        There are events to bring people together who want to start a podcast, have a podcast and have a
                        studio or on their journey to start talking and collaborating and started in October and has been
                        every month since where there has been incredible response to them and the next event will be a True
                        Crime special which will be something different.
