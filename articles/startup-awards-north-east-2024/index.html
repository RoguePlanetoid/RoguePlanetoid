                        <h5>How do they foster creativity?</h5>
                        <p>
                            Kayleigh said team is new and want to encourage return to work for Mams and have focus on work life balance and focus on social campaigns. 
                            Fraser had daily and weekly meeting and the meeting they have they allow people to bring their own information and suggestions and every team member's input is 
                            deeply valued and have over fifty different people who make those decisions. Trevor mentioned getting to know the people and play their favourite music and wear 
                            colours that fit, and they have great banter at work when going through hard times in people's lives.
                        </p>
                        <h5>What is most unconventional idea that paid off?</h5>
                        <p>
                            Kayleigh mentioned approaching big brands and being really direct with them and speak your truth to them as why wouldn't they want to work with them. Fraser mentioned 
                            in having believe that people don't believe as at one point they almost lost the building and people told them it was unachievable and worked to get funding to renovate 
                            building including a wellbeing cafe for advice and support and create a community for people to work together. Trevor mentioned that don't have to dress like Lurch so 
                            had a funeral where they had their top hat and cane wrapped in silver glitter and a diamante silver waistcoat was one of the most memorable things they have done.

                        <h5>How do you celebrate successes?</h5>
                        <p>
                            Kayleigh does a little dance, and they grab a coffee and have a little walk and go back to origins they don't have meeting in a board room they go for a little walk 
                            and a bigger one they are doing spa day. Fraser goes to things like bowling or goes out for pizza with the team. Trevor works with organisation about suicide loss so 
                            give money to them and gives back to community in other ways too.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Surprising lesson learned from failure or setback?</h5>
                        <p>
                            Kayleigh said originally they had limited and community interest company was hard but got CIC they got a lot of money then put money into website and other things 
                            and the money dried up but it seemed their brand looked too good as need to think about other groups but mental health is without physical awareness but they could 
                            put themselves into sustainability through brand partnerships but for charities it is someone else deciding so went with company side. Fraser mentioned that failing 
                            is okay as failing forward is the key message from failure. Trevor mentioned working for big companies doing three funerals every day and were paying for advertising 
                            things could go well or quiet again but when putting forward for NHS contract was massive, they didn't go into job for load of money but to help people.
