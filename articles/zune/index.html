                                Zune was first announced in September 2006 and saw the launch of another section of my original website CESPage which would cover all the main announcements from the beginning
                                of Zune, until the just before the end. It had information about the hardware, accessories along with details of the service and even exclusive wallpaper you could download! 
                                So here is an article featuring information about the devices to help celebrate twenty-five years of content from CESPage. If you want to find out more about Zune you can check
                                out another celebration of it with <a href="https://www.zunepedia.com/" target="_blank">Zunepedia</a>.
