                        <h3>Blazor a trail with .NET 8 - Peter Bull</h3>
                        <h4>What is .NET?</h4>
                        <p>
                            .NET is the free, open-source, cross platform framework from Microsoft for building modern apps and services. .NET allows developers to build apps 
                            and services for Windows, macOS, Linux and Docker along with native apps for mobile or desktop with a single codebase for Windows, macOS, iOS and 
                            Android plus build cloud-native apps that run on all major cloud provides such as Microsoft Azure and AWS or create independently deployable microservices 
                            that run on Docker. .NET has been independently verified as being faster than any other popular framework and performance has been improved in every recent 
                            release of .NET. .NET allows developers to not only build for platforms such as Windows, macOS and Linux but also build on those platforms by taking 
                            advantage of Visual Studio, the most comprehensive IDE for .NET developer on Windows or Visual Studio Code the standalone code editor for Windows, macOS 
                            and Linux. To learn more about .NET to build, test and deploy your own apps or find preview versions of .NET by visiting <a href="https://www.dot.net" target="_blank">dot.net</a>.
                        </p>
                        <h4>What's new in .NET 8?</h4>
                        <p>
                            .NET now has a new release every November with odd numbered releases supported for eighteen months as Standard Term Support or STS, and even numbered 
                            releases supported for three years as Long-Term Support or LTS. This includes .NET 8 due to be released during .NET Conf 2023 in November, but you can 
                            use .NET 8 now as there is a release candidate available along with a “Go Live” licence so can use it in production should you want to! .NET 8 adds new 
                            features such when handling JSON when it is output from an application or serialised and when it is input into an application or deserialised, including 
                            handling values that are read only or that are not public which would have had to be the case in previous versions of .NET. .NET 8 adds new Validation 
                            Attributes aimed at non-user entry data for cloud-native services such as configuration including checking if a value is in a list of allowed ones. 
                            .NET 8 also adds a new way to provide services using keys to register and consume services in applications using Dependency Injection where required 
                            functionality can be provided to another piece of functionality. .NET 8 also adds a new TimeProvider to enable time abstraction for .NET developers to 
                            mock date and time for testing. .NET 8 gets new features each release, that help both advanced and other developers improve their applications with .NET 8. 
                            You can start developing with .NET using Visual Studio for Windows, which also has a free Community edition and even optionally subscribe to GitHub Copilot 
                            for an AI pair programmer to learn or code faster with, or can develop with .NET on Windows, macOS and Linux using Visual Studio Code and can download both 
                            from <a href="https://visualstudio.com" target="_blank">visualstudio.com</a>.
                        </p>
                        <h4>What is C#?</h4>
                        <p>
                            C# is the open-source programming language for building apps with .NET but can also use F# which is a functional programming language. C# is the most popular 
                            language for .NET developers and can target any application type and platform using .NET. C# is easy to learn and read so can understand what's going on and what's 
                            going wrong. C# allows developers to be certain about a value with type safety to know if something is a string or an integer.  C# does have flexibility with 
                            types with generics allowing developers to use the same code with different types and has pattern matching so can have an object and if it is one type or another 
                            deal with it as needed. C# supports properties to control access to values of an object such as for serialisation or deserialization and it also has string 
                            interpolation allowing for expressions within strings such as values from objects and to format them. C# has async allowing for code that doesn't block other code 
                            or code that can run in the background when other code is running and includes LINQ or Language Integrated Query to allow developers to query objects, transform or 
                            manipulate data from various sources and be able to write expressive and readable code. C# is an open-source and evolving language with a new version released now 
                            with each new release of .NET and is driven by the community including what features to add or not to C#. To get started with C# or even try out some of the language 
                            features online then visit <a href="https://csharp.net" target="_blank">csharp.net</a>.
                        </p>
                        <h4>What's new in C#?</h4>
                        <p>
                            C# 12 will be released during .NET Conf 2023 with .NET 8 but can use C# now with the release candidate of .NET 8. C# 12 introduces primary constructors which are used 
                            to initialise a class or object with a set of values or other objects by supporting simpler declaration of values to be passed in and used within a class. C# also add 
                            collection expressions where values can be set to common collection values and adds support for using alias that allows for types to be referenced more easily with any 
                            type not just named types. C# 12 also will support default values for parameters in lambda expressions which are anonymous functions that allow an expression to be 
                            defined. C# gets new features with new releases of .NET which can include experimental features to give developers the chance to try something new. To learn more about 
                            .NET 8 and C# 12 then you can check out the online conference .NET Conf 2023 between the 14th and 16th of November at <a href="https://dotnetconf.net" target="_blank">dotnetconf.net</a>.
                        </p>
                        <h4>What is Blazor?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Blazor allows .NET developers to build beautiful full-stack web apps using .NET and C# without writing any JavaScript. Blazor components can be hosted in any web browser 
                            using WebAssembly for client-side experiences, hosted server-side using ASP.NET Core on Windows, macOS and Linux, or in native apps for Windows, macOS, iOS and Android. 
                            Blazor components can be created simply and efficiently that are flexible and reusable for the web or for hybrid apps on mobile and desktop. Blazor supports data binding 
                            values for visualisation and editing of data along with support for interoperability with JavaScript such as libraries and APIs. To find out more about building web apps 
                            using the power of .NET and C# without needed to write any JavaScript then visit <a href="https://blazor.net" target="_blank">blazor.net</a>.
                        </p>
                        <h4>What's new in Blazor?</h4>
                        <p>
                            .NET 8 adds streaming rendering of components allowing content in Blazor from long-running tasks to be delivered from the Server as soon as it is available and direct 
                            rending of Blazor components outside of a web app. .NET 8 will introduce a anew mode to Blazor where aren't fixed to client with WebAssembly Mode or server with Server 
                            Mode but can have best of both worlds with Auto Mode, allowing developers to have a component download from the server for super-fast delivery while downloading in the 
                            background then use WebAssembly Mode when available. Blazor in .NET 8 when using Server Rendering when users navigate to a page or submits a form instead of a full-page 
                            refresh is enhanced by intercepting the request then patching the content into the page. .NET 8 with Blazor introduces Sections where the output of content can be 
                            specified in a Section Output and then set with SectionContent along with the ability to debug WebAssembly Apps in Firefox using the Firefox Developer Tools. .NET 8 
                            continues to evolve Blazor as a full-stack web user interface framework for creating apps that render content at component or page level supporting multiple rendering 
                            modes on the client, server, or both. To find out how to build cross-platform web apps with .NET and C# for Windows, macOS, Linux or Docker using ASP.NET that powers 
                            Blazor on Server then visit <a href="https://asp.net" target="_blank">asp.net</a>.

                        <h4>Overview</h4>
                        <p>
                            NET is the open-source framework that allows developers to build modern web apps and services from Microsoft for Windows, macOS, Linux and Docker along with native apps 
                            for Windows, macOS, iOS and Android and has a new release each year with odd numbered releases supported for 18 months and even numbered releases supported for three years, 
                            with the latest version .NET 8 coming in November. C# is the modern and open-source language to target any application type and any platform using .NET with the latest 
                            version C# 12 coming with .NET 8. Blazor is for building web apps with .NET and C# without having to write any JavaScript and ASP.NET to create other web apps and services. 
                            If you're not using .NET, C# or Blazor already then you can start your journey today or if already using .NET, then why not try .NET 8 when it is available in November!
