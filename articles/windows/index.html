                                Windows 7 and Windows Phone preceded the idea of an operating system that combined both desktop and phone with Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 along with 
                                Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile. However, Windows 11 would again return to the idea of a separate operating system designed for desktop so here's a 
                                look back at Windows 7 and Windows Phone when they were first announced to help celebrate twenty-five years of content from CESPage.

                            Windows 7 was released in 2009 and was designed to be more reliable, more responsive, and to make the things you did every day easier. Windows 7 continued 
                            the idea of having different versions of the operating system that were introduced with the previous version of Windows, Windows Vista.
