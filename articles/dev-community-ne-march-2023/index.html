                            Tech Team is based on Durham they use Spec Flow testing framework and are hosted on Azure and use Angular. Authoring questions is a challenge as the 
                            standards are not suitable so they need to create a content authoring tool along with needing to creating a question bank. Test players are a 
                            challenge as these need to be consistent across different devices and have to consider different localisations as well as disabilities. 
                            Workplace environment is really good and no one will bite your head off if you do something wrong.

                        <p>
                            More than 30% food is wasted while 800 million people go to bed hungry every night. <a href="https://olioex.com/" target="_blank">Olio</a> connect neighbours with each other and local business to share food surplus rather than it being thrown away,
                            volunteers collect surplus food to be provided and they also can provide non-food items that can be sold as well. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They help people go from  "who would want this" to "I would live that", with Olio sharing is a mindset. 
                            One small share for you one giant smile for Jimmy next door. They have multiple aims for doing small things 
                            and work for a better future and have a better planet for them to live on.

                            They're on track, quick feedback loops, team is open to change, strong set of tests which are mostly integration tests and developers 
                            own the work from planning to shipping and they get time to address tech debt. They have more diversity there on average and have 
                            more women in the tech team than men and are fully remote with a couple of them living in the North East.

                        <h3>Peter Bull - Software Engineer, Bede Gaming, tutorialr.com</h3>
                        <h4>Who is Bede Gaming and what do they do?</h4>
                        <p>
                            I spoke about joining <a href="https://bedegaming.com/" target="_blank">Bede Gaming</a> as a Software Engineer for their Platform Team in February. Bede Gaming are based in Newcastle Great Park but also 
                            have offices in Bulgaria and Canada and you can work remotely. Their goal is to drive innovation in the gaming industry by developing the next 
                            generation of gaming and lottery software. Bede Gaming made me feel welcome from before I started, through to onboarding just a month ago to 
                            getting to work with my team and it feels like I have worked there so much longer.
                        </p>
                        <h4>What is Bede Gaming's tech stack and what does my team do?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Bede Gaming's Platform Team uses the latest versions of .NET where possible to create microservices running in Docker containers, data is stored 
                            using Microsoft SQL Server and communicate with Azure Service Bus and we have websites with their front-end Angular and back-end using ASP.NET Core 
                            Web APIs. Out Platform team looks after features such as Player Account Management along with other services to help ensure responsible gambling 
                            such as third-party integrations using AI to help identify or predict harmful player behaviour.
                        </p>
                        <h4>What challenges do Bede Gaming face?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Testing includes unit, integration and acceptance tests but a challenge is contention for shared resources when manually testing branches of 
                            developers which requires coordination between teams using the QA environment. Evolving the codebase with new features is also a challenge 
                            as they often require more complexity to maintain compatibility with existing code and often it can be difficult to decide when to remove 
                            older functionality which can slow down development along with needing to maintain 100% consistency as for other sectors 99% may be fine 
                            for our sector anything less than 100% could be a fine.
                        </p>
                        <h4>What else do I do?</h4>
                        <p>
                            I enjoy sharing what I know with the community on tutorialr.com for on <a href="https://www.tutorialr.com" target="_blank">tutorialr.com</a> 
                            for tutorials, talks plus workshops and <a href="https://www.rogueplanetoid.com">rogueplanetoid.com</a> for posts, articles and my brand 
                            new podcast along with attending user-groups and doing talks like Dev Community North East.
                        </p>
                        <h4>What do I love about the North East?</h4>
                        <p>
                            The North East has had vibrant technology scene this century so far with plenty of opportunities in established businesses or start-ups and it is 
                            amazing to see the support start-ups today can get to such as Ignite North East. There are also many user groups such as this one where people can 
                            get together, talk about what they're passionate about and hear from others. Over the years I've attended dozens of user groups in the North East 
                            where have meet new people and helped gain new opportunities that got where I am today including presenting at events like Dev Community North East.
