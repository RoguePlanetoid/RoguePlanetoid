                        <p>
                            A few months ago a new AI-powered <a href="https://www.bing.com" target="_blank">Bing</a> was launched, in Limited Preview, delivering improved search results along 
                            with the ability to create, compose and chat using natural language. This combined the power of large language models like GPT-4 from 
                            <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank">OpenAI</a> with the immense search index of results from Bing that are current, cited and conversational.
                            Not only this the power of Bing is integrated into <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/edge/features/ai" target="_blank">Microsoft Edge</a> along with being 
                            integrated into the Windows taskbar which reaches over half a billion people every month. Since the Limited Preview openen Bing has grown to over 
                            100 million daily active users, 200 million images have been created with Bing Image Creator and installs of the Bing app on mobile have increased 400%.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Bing Chat is now open to more people as it is moving from a Limited Preview to Open Preview so there now is no waitlist to try the AI powered features of Bing, 
                            including moving from text only chat to one that is more visual with rich image and video answers along with multi-modal support coming soon. Single use chat 
                            and search sessions are moving to multi-session productivity experiences that include chat history and persistent chats in Edge. Platform capabilities will be 
                            opened up to developers and third-parties to build upon the AI-powered features of Bing to enable people to take actions on their queries and complete any tasks. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Search will be more visual with visual answers in chat including charts and graphs along with updated formatting of answers to help people find the information 
                            they are looking for more easily. Bing Image creator which allows images to be created from natural language will be expanded to all languages supported by Bing. 
                            Microsoft Edge will be updated with redesigned elements in a sleek user interface that will also integrate the AI powered features of Bing such as chat and image 
                            creation. Chat with Bing in Edge will feature chat history which will help make chats more personalised over time by being able to bring in context from previous 
                            chats into new conversations.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            Developers will be able to create plug-ins for the Bing Chat experience with examples such as leveraging OpenTable to help find or book a reservation or create 
                            powerful visualisations with Wolfram|Alpha and get answers to complex science, maths or human-curated data-based questions. Microsoft are working closely with 
                            OpenAI to make it easier and consistent for developers to be able to create experiences that can be leveraged within Bing Chat and details of this will be shared 
                            at <a href="https://build.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Microsoft Build 2023</a>.
