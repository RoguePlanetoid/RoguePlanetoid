                        <h4>Tommy Spiro & Carl Gardiner - Digital Trade Team, Scottish Enterprise</h4>
                        <p>
                            Tommy and Carl work for Scottish Enterprise who have worked with a few of those attending. It is Scotland's international development agency to help 
                            businesses grow and scale with investment and innovation support to help online or overseas. They aim to help increase exports and get foreign investment 
                            to create jobs. During COVID the investment by big tech was mind blowing with billions being invested in research and development some of which is close 
                            to the GDP of Scotland. The investment is still there and for AI it is beginning to come of age, the scale of growth of retail and online sales has grown 
                            30% in the US and it has been relentless and companies that aren't embracing digital and international will be left behind. The B2B area has been really 
                            difficult, but the growth and investment is the secret weapon and is growing at such a rate it is such an opportunity for companies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of their big areas is to know what is out there and then move to implementation as if you don't know what is out there then you can't move forward or 
                            may have difficult questions you would have to answer. B2B is five times the size of B2C, and social commerce is growing even faster than that where the 
                            top three are Chinese platforms including Little Red Book, Wechat and Dooyin and Wechat is integrated into business with many connections to a great scale 
                            than WhatsApp. Influencer marketing for B2B will be one to watch going forward, it has moved to the authentic stage and people expect this and those are 
                            the ones that are really getting traction but don't think it is just about consumer goods but into the business-to-business area.

                        <h4>Barry McDonald - Founder 100 Coffees & ex-VP Community, Codebase</h4>
                        <p>
                            Barry has been in the startup space for the last ten years and before this was a journalist for twenty-five years. For the past eight years was involved with a 
                            company called Codebase which is one of the largest ecosystem builders in the country and forms communities and supports each other. It delivers a programme called 
                            Tech Scaler to create startups with mentorship programmes and international trips including Silicon Valley, they were VP of community and were devising strategies 
                            to bring businesses together including online communities and event strategies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They left Codebase a couple of months ago, but they are passionate about working with startups and those who want to change the world and build things. Startup scene 
                            is a busy place, and they want to work on how they can add value and how companies can scale. They put out a message on LinkedIn to go out for a coffee so came up with 
                            100 coffees where they would do this with a hundred different people including founders, investors, recruiters, students and more. Their aim was to see what opportunities 
                            there are and what is missing as before they were in many meetings but didn't have a chance to have a conversation with people.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Their journey so far is 63 coffees since March right across Scotland there isn't a scientific approach to this, they have put a message out there if anyone has anything to 
                            say and they blog about this weekly and all conversations are anonymous with mostly conversations with founders and mostly flat white coffees. What comes next is they will 
                            produce a playbook who wants to do their own 100 coffees journey, as have a theory that 100 coffees will change someone's life, and they will also write a report about the 
                            insights from that journey.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Emerging patterns, it is a complicated ecosystem that is hard to navigate and is really busy for first time founders and can get overwhelmed. Investors tell them that investor 
                            education is really needed as many first-time founders don't understand the investment landscape and some have given away far too much too early to friends, family and fool's round. 
                            University startups and spinouts needs more work and many founders in Scotland lack a global mindscape such as getting to go to London or further. Ecosystem and industry is a 
                            recurring theme is taking elements and contributing but when it becomes an industry people can feed off this and not contribute and people are extracting from this, 
                            and first-time founders need a safe space and get answers to questions such as what is an MVP etc.

                        <h4>Dawn Young & Peter Bull - Co-founders, Cluarantonn Podcast Services</h4>
                        <p>
                            Cluarantonn aims to help new or existing podcasters and be the bridge to podcasting began by their co-founders and husband and wife team Dawn Young and Peter Bull. Dawn started with 
                            podcasting a few years ago with her podcast Scottish Murders, which is a true crime podcast, but didn't know where to go or how to start but learned along the way including getting 
                            help and support from others and it is now in the top 1.5% of podcasts in the world with over 750,000 downloads. Dawn also started another podcast Scottish Digest to cover the brighter 
                            side of Scotland plus being involved in the true crime community including Crimecon, a true-crime conference, made connections and contacts in the police and beyond to start the video 
                            podcast The Blue Way. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Peter got his start in podcasting as Dawn had all the things needed at home to get started right on his desk so decided to start a monthly technology podcast, RoguePlanetoid Podcast 
                            that covers Microsoft and related technology along with other topics such as the North East tech scene. Peter has also done a studio-based podcast, Talking Inspiration, where he has 
                            interviewed people from or in the North East starting with Platform's very own Paul Lancaster.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Cluarantonn, pronounced clue-ran-ton, has a Scottish connection not only being where the co-founder Dawn is from but also the name itself, which is Gaelic, Cluaran for Thistle and Tonn 
                            for Wave which connects it to Scotland and podcasting! The logo for Cluarantonn hides a secret which is a hidden C from the name and a small bridge in reference to the slogan, a bridge 
                            to podcasting, and the overall logo resembles a podcast microphone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Cluarantonn runs monthly podcast meetup events in Newcastle upon Tyne in the North East of England and has been doing so since October last year called Podcast Paddock held in a former 
                            stable for Newcastle Breweries. Each event has been well attended and popular with many returning for subsequent events as well as attracting many new people each time with presentations 
                            and fireside chats and even full-length workshops to bring people together and has resulted in a few collaborations between those there. It has been great to have amazing speakers come 
                            and share their expertise or experiences which has also included Platform's Paul Lancaster who spoke at the first event.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Cluarantonn offer a free fifteen-minute quick chat to see how they can help a new or existing podcaster including anything that might help to get started or continue with their podcast 
                            journey. They also offer a Power Hour where people can get more in-depth answers on a one-off basis to get direction or advice on starting or growing their podcast and there is ongoing 
                            online support available with monthly group coaching online with a guest speaker or additional one-to-one coaching. Online support also includes accountability reports to ensure a 
                            podcasting journey keeps going along with Q&A any time on Slack to ask questions about anything about podcasting.
                        </p>

                            right first impression and make the most of being a guest on a podcast. There is also an opportunity to audit a podcast to help improve discoverability as podcast discoverability is one 
                            the biggest issues when doing a podcast so will offer advice and support to help mitigate this which includes a title and show notes health check as episode one is not the best title and 
                            show notes need to be clear and concise to help a potential listener along with episode format optimisation to help with segments and structure including anything that should be added, 
                            changed or removed to make a podcast stand out from the crowd.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            podcasters with products and services such as editing or studios along with those useful to podcasters such as photography for headshots or graphic design for artwork plus businesses 
                            could also advertise on a local podcast to reach potential local customers.

                            Guest tips included the best way to guest on a podcast which is to actually take the time to listen to the podcast you want to be on, plus establish connections with a potential host, 
                            follow them on social media, comment and more so when you do approach them, they may be somewhat aware of you rather than it coming out of the blue. You can also send a voice note where 
                            not only do you get a chance to pitch yourself, but they can hear how you'll sound, you can get yourself a lapel microphone for less than £20 that can be great quality and can be used 
                            for the podcast itself or you can write a great email but the main thing is to demonstrate to a host how you will add value to their audience, or if you have your own podcast how you 
                            will bring your audience to theirs.

                        <p>
                            Guest tips continued with make the most of being on a podcast which is to discuss any call to action as soon as possible rather than at the end, so if you have something to say that 
                            you're doing like a new book etc then mention that at the start and don't go deep into your background, remember that value you are adding and keep that brief as the audience wants to 
                            know who you are but they're there to listen to the topic at hand. Another key thing is to promote your appearance, you can do that beforehand but when your episode is released you 
                            have 72 hours to make the most of that so get plenty of social media posts ready to go and in many cases the host of a podcast will repost anything so you'll get an opportunity to 
                            reach that audience too.

                            Digital Sustainability to turn people into a sustainable product person. Maybe we can agree that our utopian future has human connection, nutritional tasty food and reduced poverty 
                            and hunger and increased moments of joy. We have it within us to dream big and aim for a future we all want. We know the system works well and, in a junction, where things aren't 
                            constant except the challenges that are in place.

                        <p>
                            Businesses and teams are under pressure in times of geopolitical and technological transformation where need to reduce costs, increase speed, improve quality and ignore a changing 
                            world and keep morale up. Sustainable practices in digital address current challenges by saving energy costs, enhance simplicity, reach new customers, reduce carbon emissions and 
                            motivate team to be part of something bigger or a purpose. Sustainable practices in digital address revenue, costs and risks by increasing revenue to retain existing customers.

                            They conducted research and found out that there is a shallow understanding of sustainability, sustainability is not seen as leading success criterion, it's on the individuals where 
                            have lots of passionate individuals but there are more people like this than you expect, adoption of sustainability practices is low but there is a lot of training out there including 
                            through Scottish Enterprise, companies adopt different sustainability approaches and influence on a product's sustainability varies.

                            In general, how to you make digital more sustainable includes sustainable energy which in Scotland for infrastructure is more likely, device longevity by building software for longer 
                            term use and reduce data for example 90% of data is not used again after the first three months so need to clean up or sort data better. They are charting courses for a sustainable 
                            world where can come into digital estate and reduce carbon footprint of digital and another is to empower people in sustainability by delivering workshops and offers personalised 
                            coaching for sustainable wellbeing & resilience. They offer many courses on increase knowledge, simulations and organisation and team awareness of sustainable practices.

                        <h4>Kathryn Strachan - Strategic Growth Consultant & Author of "Scaling Success"</h4>
                        <p>
                            Scaling Success - how they built a business that broke barriers. Kathryn built the CopyHouse brand from the ground up and have exited this and now helps companies get ready for 
                            investment and connect them with their own network including many in the United States where they look into expanding there. They also speak on a lot of stages and have a book 
                            "Scaling Success: How to Build a Brand that breaks barriers". Over four years they had 900% growth and during Covid didn't want to make anyone redundant so looked at ways to scale 
                            the business and look at new areas.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They got started in January 2020, they had a runway and everything they needed but didn't have foresight as no one did to predict the global pandemic, they looked at what they did 
                            well and saw a gap in the market, but they worked with travel and recruitment which were not doing as well so they positioned themselves and invested in key areas. Their strategy 
                            during Covid was defining their market position and focus and niche where a deeper focus was much better and they invested heavily in the right places, and they took care of their 
                            people and grew their team and created a company culture that could support during trying and challenging times.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defining a niche and establish a clear proposition - if you're trying to reach everyone, you'll reach no one. Think about who it is you can help and think about it as a relationship 
                            where you can build trust with people who otherwise would not have paid attention to you. They help brands or people achieve something with a product or service by helping tech brands 
                            to build better relationships with their audience with content marketing. Investing in marketing is important and they used a Covid bounce back loan to do this and it was one of the 
                            smartest moves they made and by doing this as early as possible allowed them to start building brand awareness so people knew who they were who would send leads and talent and even 
                            helped find the agency brand that bought the company and allowed them to skyrocket out of the pandemic.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            People buy from people not faceless organisations, the best leads come from their personal brand and network as people are more likely to trust a company when senior executives are 
                            active on social media and consumers are more likely to buy when a CEO of a business uses social media. Building a personal brand takes time and it won't happen overnight with their 
                            own journey taking four years and there's still much they want to do. They current approach to building a personal brand is social media, non-exec positions, their podcast 
                            Tech Marketers Uncorked, they speak at events and other podcast and built a community via as it makes sense to have multiple streams, and they network and meet new people every month.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Your network is your net worth, having a strong network allows you to solve any challenge, any time and always have someone you can count on, you might not know something, but you 
                            might know someone who does. They have a goal of meeting 50 new people every month and have met over 1,800 people which has opened doors for securing new clients and boosting the 
                            effectiveness of outreach along with establishing partnerships, finding top talent, speaking gigs and lots of other opportunities. You need to look after the people who work for you,
                            and they are a remote-first company which means you can compete with largest players for top talent, have a good company culture with a four-day week if can't afford large salaries. 
                            reduce sick leave and absences as flexible working means people could take time to do things and can then serve clients in the United States and the United Kingdom without the high 
                            salaries.

                            Employee assistance program to give employees a safe place and allowed them to emotionally offload and destress and create psychological safety which helped their employees during the 
                            pandemic but also continue to minimise issues and allow people to create their best work at work. CopyHouse scaled to $2,000,000 in four years and had large clients with global operations 
                            and won multiple awards including IOE Young Director of the Year, The Drum Response to Change and CEO of the year. You can work with them to help build go-to-market strategies, shape 
                            pitch narrative and build relationships and build roundtable dinners and speak at events.

                        <h3>In Conversation With...</h3>
                        <h4>Rajesh Mair - Founder & CEO Trignomix</h4>
                        <p>
                            Rajesh is CEO and founder of Trignomix, he has been around for a few years doing things and has been in Edinburgh for the past few years but was based in Newcastle before that. He came 
                            from defence and electronics sector, but their ultimate passion is to be involved in organisations to help them revolutionise their industries along with mentoring organisations 
                            including startups and has non-exec roles and roles in charities. They are keen to spin off a platform to improve patient and social care from a patient's point of view. They set 
                            up a company Newcastle originally but over the years they switched to Edinburgh but never lost that connection as from a funding point of view the North East has been quite kind.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Their journey is they came out of the engineering and electronics side and they helped with electronic systems on surveillance and then moved to industrial computing and AoT and then 
                            moved to automotive in Sunderland and then soon after moved to Siemens and lived out in Germany for a period of time where the manufactured semiconductors which was a billon pound 
                            startup but after five years the company had floated and that became a separate organisation and the Newcastle plant was shut down but this was an opportunity to start their own company. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They had a years' worth of salary which gave them the chance and they had a great piece of advice which was to have the right people around you, they had the advantage to go to 
                            potential clients and tell them their value proposition to see if they needed a resource and they were going to people and saying if they had some customers would they be interested 
                            and the first contract was £70,000 and kicked off creating automation solutions but the market was quite down at the time so it was a challenge and their marketing wasn't so great 
                            but still knocked on doors and grew the company but then started to get knockback so decided to exit from that business.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They started to move towards a more consultancy and help businesses revolutionise their industry by bringing in automated processes in their business and bringing in data from all 
                            over the business and align this with the technology. They've also helped with other sectors such as NHS and waste management with the common thread and niche which is they help 
                            drive a develop a company in a hands on role, when they started with developing IT was process flow and automation but as they progressed they did more including social enterprise 
                            where they offer their time pro-bono to help people get back into work. It was also about electronic refurbishment which opened doors in the waste sector and their focus was on 
                            tracking there and the healthcare sector including patient data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They were concerned about how things would move forwards, but it has always been about them and their relationships, and the weakness is still marketing which is something people need 
                            to look at. The stage they are at now is repositioning businesses by helping with costs, capacity and planning along with productivity, compliance, net zero, secure supply chains and 
                            smooth introduction to IT. They bring data together in a meaningful way across a business to deliver efficiencies and increase performance. They will bring that data together by 
                            looking at the strategic layer of the business with management, operational layer for how supply chains work together and how you can elevate data and streamline processes and make 
                            the connections in a business. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Providing the skills at the right time as organisations don't always have the resource, so they help bring those teams together, the strategic stage, innovation stage and delivery stage 
                            and assisting this with mentoring, consulting, business analysis, UX and service design along with other support. Case Study of Waste Management was to create data driven decision making 
                            for a broker who used to subcontract their waste collection services, they came wanting barcode readers but it was to ask them common sense questions which was they had hundreds of bins 
                            and question was how many and who would use them and this wasn't going to be the way forward to get the profit and growth so their processes were mapped out and they like to have a long 
                            relationship with customers in that case was over seven years and grew them from 9 million to 60 million to improve processes and a technology portal to connect information and use 
                            sustainability measures to demonstrate this to clients, but to get there they needed to change their model. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There's always challenges involved such as responsibilities in partnership and joint ventures and needing to manage your culture and people along with measuring your success with clients 
                            and lessons learned includes focus and knowing your arrow.
