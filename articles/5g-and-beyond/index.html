                        <h3>Introduction to 5G and Use Cases - Kostas Katsaros</h3>
                        <h4>What is 5G?</h4>
                        <p>
                            From a design and architecture viewpoint is that 5G is a cellular network which is made up of terminals which are devices that connect to the network and then is a spectrum to 
                            transmit signals between terminals and the antennas which is a radio access network, and these are connected to the core network with a backhaul network which allows other 
                            services to be connected along with access and control mechanisms. Evolution of cellular networks which has offered users more experiences rather than just a connectivity network 
                            and is software defined centric providing integration between communication and compute and 5G is expected to transform business and way we work including IoT devices, faster 
                            connections and ultra reliable critical connections and being more enterprise focus.
                        </p>
                        <h4>What Drives 5G?</h4>
                        <p>
                            5G compared to 4G has more 3x spectrum efficiency, 10x reduced latency, higher throughput and connection density along with 100x more capacity and network efficiency. Supports 
                            more critical applications, more uniform throughput a huge number of IOT devices and energy consumption per bit is reduced. Driving 5G is demand for more throughput and capacity 
                            along with lower delays and higher reliability. There is also a demon for massive number of connections for IoT as well as safety critical applications such as self-driving 
                            cars and 5G is the first cellular technology to meet these requirements with one platform.
                        </p>
                        <h4>5G Use Cases</h4>
                        <p>
                            Extreme mobile broadband which is improving throughput such as with Augmented Reality which needs more throughput along with CCTV for streaming high-definition video. Massive 
                            Scale Communication for IoT devices and there are also Ultra Reliable Low Latency Services. You could have on-site and in-factory production optimisation for more responsive and 
                            more intelligent robots and could have monitoring and management of goods across the supply chain along with product in-service maintenance and end-of-life management. There is 
                            business ready, showcase level and R&D level applications of 5G which can range from low, medium and high impact applications.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Why is 5G important?</h4>
                        <p>
                            5G enables new business models and a new way or tunning mobile infrastructure through, the biggest 5G business opportunities are in supporting specific 5G-enabled services 
                            tailored for specific vertical markets, it is the fusion of enhance bandwidth, low latency and very high density that makes it capable of supporting different services from 
                            different industries. 5G enabling technologies include Software Defined Networks or SDN which separates user from control plane for more automated provisioning. Multi-Access 
                            Edge Computing (MEC) enabled IT and computing capabilities at the edge and Network Slicing allows dedicated resources for specific applications such as IoT, robotics and other 
                            time-critical applications where requirements are highly differentiated such as end-to-end network delay and capacity along with reliability and security. 
                        </p>
                        <h4>5G Architecture</h4>
                        <p>
                            5G service-based architecture is where control plane and common data repositories are delivered by a set of interconnected NFs and uses cloud-native principals and deal with 
                            service discovery, load balancing and more with a modular framework for networks that can be self-contained, independent and reusable. 5G spectrum supports a range of bands 
                            from sub 1Ghz for long range low data throughput and 1-6 GHz for urban coverage with medium capacity and above 6GHz or millimetre wave is very high capacity, but short range 
                            enabled with high density small cells.
                        </p>
                        <h4>5G Deployment</h4>
                        <p>
                            5G deployment options can have cores such as EPC, 5GC and then have non-standalone with LTE anchor with split control and data or standalone with LTC 5G NR with same control 
                            and data. 5G is evolving with different releases from when it was first introduced in 2019 and not all capabilities have been deployed. Features include mobility enhancements, 
                            QoS for gaming and network slicing plus there has been network deployment and automation features added. Further improvements are planned, and it is still evolving, and it 
                            addresses a wide range of applications, and it converges IT/computer and Networking/Communications with cloud-native principals.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Real World Application of 5G and Immersive Technology - Philip Sandford</h3>
                        <p>
                            <a href="https://www.vodafone.co.uk/" target="_blank">Vodafone</a> installed their first site in 2019 and have been working on rolling it out across the UK and have recently 
                            introduced 5G standalone allowing 5 million more connections and can get more capacity and usage from their network. They have worked on lowering latency below 10-20Ms to 
                            deliver instant connectivity which is vital for live coverage and immersive technology for high bandwidth high data applications. Mobile Private Networks which are a segregated 
                            network to be installed that gives all benefits of 5G in a secure environment for a private network.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Vodafone are the first to operate a 5G network slice to offer quality and service and control where one application uses Virtual Reality as its use case and is an exciting 
                            time for connectivity in general such as the Digital Catapult and Sunderland Software City partnership. How you engage with Vodafone is they have their own innovation 
                            programmes to use Vodafone equipment in innovation labs and get in touch with experts along with testing applications and do joint marketing to get your brand and company 
                            out there. There is also a marketplace to allow your applications to be sold not only in the United Kingdom but across the globe. You can get free access to technical advice 
                            and equipment. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Vodafone also have a Tomorrow Street program where they host and support next generation of technology providers and if those get used with other organisations or Vodafone. 
                            They are aiming to get more adoption of 5G and interested in use-cases of 5G and have built a range of these and they don't have the capability to develop these use-cases but 
                            they can combine their network and capacity with the companies building applications such as providing VR-based safety training  and enable delivering of applications to 
                            customers, they will present to various customers about what applications are using Vodafone's network.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Vodafone has come a long way with 5G with programmes to support start-ups and scale-ups and help drive things forward to help leverage the 5G platform they are building and 
                            want companies within the North East Combined Authority area to work with them.
