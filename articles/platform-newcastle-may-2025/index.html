                    <h4>Paul Wilson - Managing Director Catalyst Recruitment & Founder, Datalyst</h4>
                    <p>
                        Paul began in accountancy which led into recruitment and recruiting a lot of finance people and they then started their journey to start 
                        Catalyst Recruitment up and get involved in all sorts of different areas including technical recruitment along with sales, marketing, 
                        design, R&D. They also founded an event with the North East Accountancy Awards and was involved with it for the first ten years and 
                        recruitment business went well and diversified and let to recruiting to larger businesses including EY which the Newcastle office is 
                        the largest outside of London and have helped them through a period of growth from fifteen and today has over seventy people, this 
                        is one kind of work they do as a recruiter and the other type is candidate led with people with marketable and niche skills, they are 
                        a bit of a tech enthusiast and many people they spoke to were responsible for tech in the business and the work they did led to candidate 
                        led recruitment work with someone who took an interesting career path from accounting to reporting and then moved into robotics and 
                        automation and they have now moved into a senior data engineer role. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They were looking for employers for this person which led to an event at The Catalyst hosted by a group The Analyst Network North East 
                        they put on a great event and met employers were hoping to meet but they were looking for people to do what they do which is put on 
                        networking events  and they said they would see what they could do but saw there were gaps with people from commercial and industrial 
                        side. There was common language about the tech they were using and wondered about bringing the communities together so went to director 
                        of the National Institute for Data and then went to previous community of North East Accountancy Awards and others and found they all 
                        came on onboard and Datalyst was formed. Datalyst covers data governance, visualisation and more where data and tech come into these 
                        subjects including robotics and automation, AI use cases along with audit and quality. There's very little cost in the event and is 
                        looking to be a promising day with a cross section of subjects that will be of interest to many people and is on the 12th of June.

                        brought over to the business protection side. They know what it is like when someone doesn't have this in place when dealing as an executor

                        Different areas of protection include relevant life cover and death in service and make sure there is money there if something should 
                        happen, protecting key people in the business and that business loans are protected and can have income protection on an executive basis.

                        valuation are accurate, and shareholders remain in control and beneficiaries receive share value. Business loan insurance where business

                    <h4>Mitali Deypurkaystha - Founder, Impact Icon</h4>
                    <p>
                        Mitali helps to see AI that fits and ROI that proves it. The main areas in your business to be looking at when AI comes as AI will completely 
                        revolutionise business which will blow the internet out of the water. Why are most businesses falling behind are feeling overwhelmed with 
                        thousands of AI tools for thousands of tasks. Businesses have no idea what is possible, it is not just ChatGPT and Large Language Models, 
                        you don't know what you don't know. Scared of the systemic impact if you get it wrong and resistant to reducing human experiences and change 
                        can feel effortful and expensive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They have spoken to many business owners who got it wrong, poor AI drained more than money, I lost their trust to lead, I had no proof - just 
                        excuses. They've been under pressure too which was they felt need to innovate but what if they do it wrong or breaks their processes and wrote 
                        a small AI programme a year ago and within two weeks fell in love with it and realised that SMEs will benefit from this and are now certified 
                        on how to implement AI into businesses that work that get a real return on investment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They are industry rockstar qualified which was a twelve-month programme to have the best knowledge on how to implement AI for businesses which 
                        helped get them Virgin Startup funding. They do know what they are talking about and a there's a lot of people out there who just did a 
                        ten-hour course. They set up Impact Icon to make impactful AI easy and affordable since it is a necessary transformation. AI is transforming 
                        business in many areas including marketing, sales, admin, customer service, finance, IT and security along with leadership and culture building.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Two shifts for future readiness, ChatGPT is like is your GP it is your first port of call as a good general understanding but are not a 
                        specialist but as a business you need to differentiate yourself as everyone is doing the same thing. Three tools include other than ChatGPT 
                        which is a generalist but can work with a specific model for sales and marketing if wanting to do this for specialist knowledge. Turn 
                        conversations into intelligence which listens to your calls and give real time feedback and collates the information after the call trained 
                        on the best customer service calls which means have the foundation of the best customer service people in the world whereas ChatGPT has been 
                        trained on everything. Voice cloning is something else you can use which you could use to send out voice notes to everyone who came to an 
                        event and be personalised by dynamically changing out the name.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Second mindset shift is there is a whole world beyond ChatGPT, and data is the real next interesting thing with AI, if don't have real data 
                        form your business then AI is just a generalist. The reality of getting this wrong and why it is important to get it right, they felt when 
                        waking up they felt something had changed and were perimenopausal and sought medical practitioners and met a lovely doctor a few weeks ago 
                        who told them they were as they had the right data and shared the same south Asian background. AI can't be biased but the wrong data fed in 
                        will make them that way which included Amazon who trained an AI to go through CVs, and it has stopped accepting applicants from women because 
                        most successful CVs had been from men. As business owners we have a bigger mission to get this right as can have a really negative impact if 
                        the data is not clean or correct so need to ensure that no one is being left behind. They want to create a positive impact with AI in 
                        communities and beyond. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Three-steps for AI in your business meetup and discuss current AI opportunities and do a future-ready assessment then team up and implement 
                        a simplified customised AI and then see long-term results and guaranteed return on investment and help create AI that supports a vision, stay 
                        calm and clear an in control, AI that works and feels right, make sure you collect and store data in the right way before you adopt AI.

                    <h4>Aidan Dunphy - Product Transformation Consultant, Samepage</h4>
                    <p>
                        Bridging the strategy Faultline. Aiden has been working in tech industry for many years and specialise in product strategy for product 
                        businesses including larger businesses but are mainly interested in SMEs who have got stuck and don't know what to do next they help there. 
                        The missing middle of strategy is you have people at the top of the business, middle managers and then people doing the real work and people 
                        at the top get consultants in and they cascade this down the business to implement a strategy but the people at the top can't translate this 
                        down-level so they make their own strategies but all these involve that department getting more resources and when tension builds and each 
                        department interacts so get silos happening in businesses. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Why does this happen? How many people have actually been trained in doing strategies. People are different so salespeople are different from 
                        engineers, but customers want what they need and there's ideas radiating from all of these. There are four fundamental motives which is to save 
                        money, innovate, out-compete and be a great place to work but it is difficult to do these things at the same time as they can conflict with 
                        each other so there needs to be a compromise to balance this out. Silos form around competency domains, strategy is about different parts of 
                        a business towards shared goals.

                        You need negotiators that are specialists and generalists who have a deep expertise in one area, but you can decide to be a specialist and 
                        generalist. Identifying the target which is difference between building the right thing and building the thing right but there is also 
                        pressured to build it fast if build too slowly. Sales generally needs to happen quickly and engineering aims to build to high quality and 
                        product management aims to deliver it right and need to balance urgency with sustainability. Owning tough lifecycle choices with introduction, 
                        growth, maturity and decline so know when to give up or to pivot. Product people are better connected within the business as they have to be 
                        in order to do their job so are the glue within the business, but it isn't a new idea to have a role about someone responsible for a product 
                        as it dates back to 1931 for a brand manager.

                        Product management's image problem is that they don't have a real job or don't do anything, but it seemed designers really hate them. But what 
                        are they supposed to be like you need to focus on creating customer value by leveraging competitive advantage and decisions are made on the 
                        basis of objective evidence not opinion or authority. Strategy is easy to describe and hard to do, it is a set of choices and choosing not 
                        to do good ideas as you can't do them all you need to focus on something you can actually execute. There's a lot of bad strategy about such 
                        as saying to grow by a certain date and not saying how. Strategy is about painful choices and prioritising as you can't do everything, 
                        data doesn't lead anywhere as it knows nothing it just is, what you do with it is what counts, data informed decisions are still better 
                        than hunches and make sure to look out for cognitive bias and data can fool sometimes. Set out direction and things you are going to be 
                        doing at different levels in the company.

                        How AI might help? Their first foray into AI where in 1984 heard about AI and tried to build a large language model on a Commodore 64! The 
                        two inevitable consequences of AI is AI slop content or humanity will be subjugated or destroyed. In the meantime, it can be incredibly 
                        disruptive, although it is still not entirely living up the hype. Vibe coding is building software conversationally and if do it long enough 
                        it becomes stupid and reintroduces issues resolved previously for example. If your job can be automated then your job as at risk by AI, AI 
                        is causing CEOs wonder if they need project managers at all, there are fewer entry-level product manager roles and fewer new product 
                        initiatives. Can AI create novel business ideas, can I produce research ideas that can convince humans or AI that it is more creative, 
                        and it seems it can. The human race isn't set to be idle just yet as AI has created new roles and AI is not just up to customer service 
                        of human contact people still want. AI is getting rid of the busy work and using it for the things it should do, and humans do what we 
                        should do. Humans are good at creativity and empathy and being unique, but AI is good at analysing huge amounts of data. Would you 
                        entrust an AI to make important business decisions on your behalf?

                    <h3>In Conversation With...</h3>
                    <h4>Jim Scott - Managing Director, Rightmove</h4>
                    <p>
                            Jim had a really successful career at Sage for twenty years and Paul has also worked for Sage although they didn't work together but 
                            came back later to be their inbound social media specialist. Jim started in telesales at Sage selling their software to small businesses 
                            and the first half of being there was operational side and the second part of their time was more strategic in nature and they had a 
                            change of CEO who left and a new CEO wanted to regionalise the business so could solve things once for the benefit of everyone and 
                            asked him to setup the small business strategy across the world and the last job he did was to setup their first global partner programme 
                            as every country had different partner agreements but did this within a year. They then setup their own consulting firm for a few years 
                            for leadership and coaching for different businesses including recruitment and tech then one of Sage's competitors wanted to migrate 
                            a legacy application into the cloud and then joined Rightmove.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During his career at Sage, Jim did most of the senior roles which is quite a unique experience to do that and then leave, at the time there 
                        was a specific direction of travel in the company and a friend of theirs had set up a company and asked them to run it but they didn't want 
                        to do that but came on as a non-exec but someone was selling a business and they wanted to buy this and ran this well until Covid but it was 
                        a really different environment. Until you wake up with the real worries of a small business as you can't appreciate it and wished they had 
                        the knowledge then they have now. When Paul went back to the business the same people were there or have been there their whole career as it 
                        is such a unique company but can get institutionalised, Paul wanted to be a disrupter which the top and bottom levels wanted but the middle 
                        management pushed back on this. The last six or seven years at Sage for Jim were quite interesting with the new CEO with many keen or not 
                        so keen what he was doing to move perpetual licences to subscriptions, but the business went through necessary and disruptive change and 
                        culturally today they are in a more stable place. Sage was the first billion-pound company in the North East but Jim has nothing but happy 
                        memories at Sage and wouldn't have got the opportunities they got there in other organisations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Common themes with consultancy with different companies and different people was the problems are the same, the circumstances are different, 
                        but the remedies are similar or the same. The common thread there are no new problems as they have all be solved before, corporates will say 
                        they don't want to bring someone in to tell you what the problems are and make you face up to them but you can hang around and help implement 
                        the changes and work through the solutions and when you get past starting the execution process is when you can hand it back over to them. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jim didn't enjoy their time at Iris as the culture was not for them as they were a big believer of doing the right thing, sometimes you need 
                        to make decisions that may have impact in the short term such as how much to increase prices on an annual basis and too high a number wasn't 
                        fair as their pricing were quite high but the role itself there was quite interesting. The challenge was the business had been functionalised 
                        and wanted to divisionalise the business and get things off the desktop and into the cloud and once they got this achieved, they got tapped 
                        by Rightmove.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jim is really enjoying Rightmove, and it is like how Sage used to be, but it is not as big as you think it is and has a turnover of 
                        £460,000,000 but manage a 73% margin which is impressive and difficult to maintain but culturally it is like Sage in the good old days. 
                        Rightmove is 900 staff across three sites in Newcastle, London and Milton Keynes and a lot of home working, it is big, but it is not big 
                        for the kind of revenue and business they have. Jim was interested in Rightmove as they have been in software for thirty years but 
                        Rightmove is an advertising business as agents pay Rightmove to advertise their stock, they're not a tech business but an advertising 
                        business but Rightmove bought a business in Newcastle which was a referencing business to check your employer, how much you earn and 
                        did you trash your last place. They didn't know how to get to enquiry to referencing and wanted someone to help with this to build 
                        products, Enquiry Manager to improve listing to get more information, there is a huge imbalance in rental properties with thirty five 
                        people on average per property and the software would filter this down to those most likely and other software would deal with tenancy 
                        agreement and deposit with Tenancy Manager which was gaps between listing and referencing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jim is MD for rental services at Rightmove and were conscious before coming in did a lot of research on the business and had a game plan 
                        and the founder of the part of the business who sold it is still around in the business. They keep themselves honest and try really hard 
                        and have a plan no matter what business they go in on how to get a team on board etc and executed the plan in the same way as if they were 
                        coaching someone to do it but are more sensitive on the impact some of the decisions on the finances of people in the business. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Newcastle business was acquired for part of the rental business and are still based here but with a newer office, which is the base of 
                        the rental business and Jim runs the business as a consultant and have annual meetings, monthly meetings and operational meetings per 
                        week at the start where talk about running the business and lead indicators and one at the end to talk about the numbers and not about 
                        operational topics. There's a good mix of doing things face-to-face and doing things remotely.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jim's biggest regret was not doing enough due diligence on a company on a cultural perspective and as their career progresses the 
                        culture has to be right for them and they did a lot of due diligence on Rightmove and got details of two people who worked there and 
                        talked about them in relation to the culture and also quizzed the CEO on this and really pushed hard on this as if they'd done that 
                        before things would have been much happier and smoother. Jim doesn't need an awful lot, so the security of a good salary and a good 
                        culture is a good option for them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Net Zero is a huge thing as part of Rightmove and is one of their strategic pillars and growth for rent is a fast-growing industry 
                        and are helping those building this to see how things can be marketed well and are engaged with energy companies as sell to tenants 
                        to make sure that this is done as environmentally conscious as possible. Bills included is one of the biggest search terms so Rightmove 
                        are using AI to dynamically pull through data from most energy providers to see what it will cost as close as possible for a property. 
                        Rental market does require putting money into properties and many will find there will be a lot of consolidation and individual landlords 
                        will sell and those will go into bigger portfolios and larger rental businesses but there needs to be amendments to new legislation to 
                        avoid any unintended consequences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rightmove has a lot of eyeballs on site, every person eligible to buy a property in the UK they are presenting eight properties per day 
                        to that group, the entertainment value of Rightmove is right up there so what can you do there and the question can you put products and 
                        services you can't get anywhere else or be cheaper than anywhere else but there are a lot of conversations going on about that.
