                        <h3>Kongfidence in Your APIs - Richard Lee-Turner</h3>
                        <p>
                            Richard who is a Senior Platform Engineer at Capgemini talked about What is Kong, why would you use it, community and enterprise features 
                            and alternatives along with deployment topologies. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What is Kong? It is a reverse proxy and API gateway and simplifies point of entry and is built on NGINX and Lua and designed to scale across 
                            environments. There are community and enterprise options and is an open-source API gateway where enterprise brings a GUI and developer portal. 
                            It has routing and load balancing features, authentication and authorisation, rate limiting and integrations with third parties and is flexible 
                            where you deploy it. You can deploy it across a range of environments.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Why would you use Kong? It is platform agnostic and no lock into a specific cloud provider and teams can define their config and security 
                            authentication and can be deployed with or without databases and in hybrid and cloud hosted models and has over seventy open-source community 
                            plugins with support for OIDC, MTLS and Vault support. Supports observability with insights against targeted flows and is lightweight.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Enterprise supports proxy caching and advanced rate limiting and for deployment there is a self and SaaS solution with more GUIs and workspaces 
                            for separating flows into multiple areas with access to enterprise plugins and enterprise level support. Alternatives are AWS API Gateway which 
                            has deep integration with AWS but single cloud lock in as does Azure API Management which has deep integration with Azure Product set. Mulesoft 
                            Anypoint is another alternative which is more in legacy and data driven areas and requires a larger amount of resource due to feature set and 
                            focus on data analysis. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Traditional deployment method is a Kong Gateway instance with a database where these instances are clusters in a traditional deployment, and a 
                            Kong Gateway cluster allows to scale system horizontally by adding more machines to handle more incoming requests. All instances within a cluster 
                            will run with the same config. There is also DB-less mode but functionality is limited with reduced plugins and rate limiting. Hybrid mode is most 
                            popular where have database as self-managed control plane node and distributes to data planes which could be on prem or cloud as just need 
                            connectivity for config. Availability of database doesn't affect availability of the Data Planes as if it loses connectivity it uses stale 
                            configuration for that time and admins only need to interact with the control plane nodes to monitor the entire status of the deployment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Kong Gateway AI is a specialised middleware layer to pair with language models to secure interactions with large language models and other 
                            AI-powered services such as prompt engineering controls and token usage analytics. Konnect SaaS is the software as a service solution where 
                            control plane is fully managed in the cloud, the DB is also managed in the cloud and data planes can be hybrid or in the cloud and get all 
                            the enterprise features with pay as you go or subscription models and seems to be the direction Kong is pushing towards.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Kong is to minimise impact and demand on services and if have lots of services a gateway acts as a single point of inspection and can spread 
                            out on the back end and is a flexible solution with config and content along with useful plugins to tailor what you do and don't need in your 
                            environment, may want to use a different security protocol you could do this and there is a lot of third-party and enterprise support.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Enterprise solution cost varies on gateways and SaaS solution on what you are using it for and can be around $200 per month but if have more APIs 
                            it does cost more and if a heavy user and depends on traffic on how much it costs, could be small or massive. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Certifications - Dan Farrall</h3>
                        <p>
                            Dan Farrall, Senior Platform Engineer at Gapgemini talked about the certification model at Gapgemini who have a reward for doing so to level up your 
                            career where they will pay for certifications and one of their goals was a Kubestronaut and then became a Golden Kubestronaut and also some Microsoft 
                            certifications as well. They have become more skilled in a number of areas and is not tying but is an investment in them and have had no challenges 
                            about relevance of exams and has got them approved and been paid for them and have earned more from rewards than exam fees paid for by Capgemini.
                        </p>
                        <h3>To Cache and Beyond - Hamed Gholamian</h3>
                        <p>
                            Hamed is a Senior Platform Engineer at Capgemini and talked about Caching. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What is Caching? Caching stores temporary copy of data for faster access for local cache or edge and can reduce repeated requests to origin and 
                            can save requests to disk and common types include browser, server-side or CDN edge and caching depends on how things are set up but can have 
                            different ways of doing caching which can improve speed and reduce backend load. Before the Edge their old platform was stable but tightly 
                            coupled with a lot of non-cloud technology and was a lot of moving parts and was a bit of difficulty there and changes were slow and heavy, 
                            they needed cloud-native flexibility and faster evolution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Choosing what works, choosing the best partners like Cloudflare, Fastly and Cloudfront where Fastly use Varnish which is an open-source caching 
                            engine. They needed a seamless native fit as everything was on AWS and were looking for something simplified and with an agile architecture so 
                            chose CloudFront as their entire ecosystem was in AWS so could do native integration, there was cost visibility and automation potential as had 
                            one account in AWS and for security and compliance would be provided by others but it made more sense to use CloudFront.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They took an intuitive approach and did discovery and planning as first phase to see what they would do and move and the next part was a proof 
                            of concept, they needed to see if it would give them what they need and then do incremental adoption and asked about shifting services to this 
                            platform to teams and then perform continuous improvement as there would be issues and snags so how do you move forwards. Tooling includes 
                            Terraform, Jenkins and Kubernetes with an IaC first approach for consistency and shared scripts and templates for faster onboarding and 
                            automated edge deployments for reliability to also help other developers come along the journey with them. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            People and paths, there are lot of teams and need to go to the right people as have many teams with many apps and priorities with apps with a 
                            lot of dependencies as one service could have a lot of dependencies. Coordination slowed progress as lot of time had to speak to developers 
                            and team leads and depended on availability but trust grew through small wins, moving smaller applications that were less sensitive and can 
                            prove these things that work and show a platform is steady, cloud native and reliable can gain some trust along with clear communication 
                            helped, going to teams and asking for their help to find out how services worked.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            First steps were onboarding apps and started onboarding with early adopter apps, there were some unexpected issues and things that worked 
                            before weren't working and it turned out to be an upstream issue from somewhere else but realised they needed a safer way to test, they needed 
                            a way to test the process without bothering the teams so created a test app that would unblock them. This test app was a sand box for 
                            experiments, can't just be an application that returns 200, it could post data and do some interactions on the back end, can delete some 
                            data so create a dummy application that has some endpoints and can give dummy data but can push it as hard as they can and get the 
                            behaviour they wanted, this would also validate changes safely. This test app could build confidence across teams and can show evidence 
                            that it works as expected.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Testing without the risk with the test app could simulate traffic safely and see how things are affected, isolate CloudFront changes from live 
                            users with no production risk and no angry stakeholders. Challenges and how they adapted were CloudWatch logs came mid journey as this wasn't 
                            available at the beginning of using CloudFront which was very challenging, access logs were written into S3 buckets but for many apps this was 
                            very difficult so they wrote Grabtacular to fetch and parse S3 logs and used this for troubleshooting such as seeing what happened with a 
                            particular distribution and URL. Kinesis wasn't an option for them along with other reasons made it a bit more difficult with many applications 
                            to migrate. Their configuration for Terraform was getting bigger so wrote tools to manage these configuration scripts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What they learned and unlearned was though discovery they need to validate in practice not on paper, it might sound like a task is easy such 
                            as migrating an application may take a lot of changes to get to that point. Defaults are starting points not solutions, sometimes turning 
                            something on doesn't work and instead causes issues. Sometimes best practices don't fit and that's okay, they found things that didn't apply 
                            that made things worse. People matter more than tools, all the communications and people helping would help more and clarity beats speed 
                            every single time, sometimes going to a team and asking if something isn't working and get their help or help them.
                        </p>
