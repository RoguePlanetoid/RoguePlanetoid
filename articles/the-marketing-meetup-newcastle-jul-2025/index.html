                    <h3>The Power of Podcasting & It's Place in the Marketing Mix - Ashleigh King</h3>
                    <p>
                        Ashleigh is the host of the Nurture your Zest Podcast and the talk is why you should podcast and
                        that it is useful to be a marketing strategy and top trends. There is Samanth, Joes and Chloe who
                        were also here to film the talk. Some awesome things that have happened has been skill development
                        since they started podcasting including how to hold your voice in a room. They have done paid
                        speaking opportunities and even a cameo on Dragon's Den and have guested and had guests on podcasts
                        along with expert opinion in the press including their thoughts about Megan Markle's podcast and
                        reached out when Kim Kardashian released her new podcast. They have been able to create their own
                        studio and create podcasts for other people and be able to talk to businesses and help people to
                        start their own podcast including being an expert in residence at the BIPC plus they have had
                        support from Creative UK to start a podcasting course.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ashleigh talked about the macro factors around podcasting which can be from a political point of view is
                        more freedom of speech than censorship with US having the top podcast listeners by country and China
                        is second and these are different about content and approach along with considering which podcasters
                        are on the far right or far left from Andrew Tate to people calling for action from society. When
                        starting a podcast where do your views sit and can think about the use of podcasts as a political
                        tool where Donald Trump has been mentioned or been on 70,000 podcasts and Kamala Harris was just
                        mentioned on 14,000 podcasts. People have an opportunity to connect, and they can be used more to be
                        a political tool and then how do you know what is right and wrong and what is ethics around this.
                        Economic part of podcasting is a low barrier of entry with high competition but can stand out based
                        on your own unique selling point or unique value proposition including North Girls Love Gravy who
                        did a pilot of four episodes and now do brand partnerships with Fenwick and Greggs and there is My
                        Ordinary Life where are passionate about teaching and educating about learning disabilities which is
                        about ordinary lives of people who struggle with disability. You can stand out if you know what to
                        talk about.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Podcasts don't make money because you have a podcast as only a small minority of content creators
                        make money but by having a podcast often leads to other opportunities and there are other ways to
                        monetise a show including affiliate links or partnerships with brands. There is also a case for
                        diversity in podcasting and can reach people on audio or audio and video and you can have
                        transcripts and have ways to support people in their preferred route to consume your content. For
                        example, they had someone who came on as a guest on a podcast, Lucy Reynolds who has a unique speech 
                        pattern as they have Cerebral Palsy, but their episode had one of the most downloads. You can talk 
                        about things that are important to you and open your world so everyone can learn more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Reaching diverse audiences as can engage hard to reach communities who listen to podcasts on a
                        regular basis including the purple pound who have money to spend who have accessibility issues. AI
                        advancements mean people can adopt podcasting faster and can quickly repurpose content with as with
                        Choppity or with tools as part of podcast workflow and marketing tasks including transcripts and
                        show notes.

                    <p>
                        Advantage of audio podcasts is it is an intimate experience that can listen while doing something
                        else from driving to dishes and barrier is low where could record a voice memo and upload this but
                        need to think about the quality and for audio there is lack of visual appeal and discoverability so
                        can put it on YouTube as people search there. People are more likely to listen to an audio podcast
                        all the way through up to 80% compared to 20-40% for video. Advantage of video is it is more
                        accessible for different speech patterns and can reach different audiences with visual engagement,
                        but the disadvantage is that the cost and effort is higher as doing more work to check over audio
                        and video and people aren't always comfortable being videoed or on camera but could do things with
                        Zoom or Riverside where quality is better.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other things to think about is legal, including defamation so need to think about what you say about
                        other people, if thinking about using the word allegedly then need to be careful so everything you
                        say is correct and can fact check and are comfortable about saying or not share anything that isn't
                        factual or avoid trauma mining. Copyright and intellectual property can be where using music can be
                        an issue so can buy or license music but if want to talk about favourite songs can link to a Spotify
                        playlist. Podcasts are more environmentally friendly and can go anywhere in the world so quickly,
                        but the huge data requirements may include huge video files so be mindful for what you are keeping
                        and if you have what you need move on and delete old footage.

                        Jason M. Lemkin is the godfather of SAAS who mentioned about giving value from just a few people to
                        get results, sometimes just one person is enough. Their show isn't huge, but they are happy with the
                        results, so if the podcast is working and meets your needs this is great. Podcast listeners are 80%
                        more likely to listen to most or all of an episode and podcast listeners spend an average of 6 hours
                        and 39 minutes per week listening to podcasts and 74% of listeners feel a deeper connection to the
                        brands they hear.

                    <p>
                        Hasn't everyone got a podcast? According to Spotify there are 6 million podcasts, but less than
                        400,000 podcasts produced new content in the last 30 days, and a lot of podcasters quit or lose
                        momentum which means with consistent effort you can get results. Why do podcasts fail? Podfade which
                        is running out of steam, people worry if it Is interesting enough, might not know what to do,
                        unrealistic expectations of those who can start but not keep to level they are expecting, ego driven
                        podcasts are not sustainable and clarity around goals is key.

                        with people hungry and thirsty for content. A single podcast episode can create content from social
                        clips, audio grams, blog posts and so many other different things where can do one thing that you
                        can then chop into smaller pieces to expand reach and allow you to share more stories. Short form
                        content is the best way to grow your audience and can experiment with titles and thumbnails. They
                        have been able to grow the views on the Nurture your Zest podcast with short form content.

                        consider brands they hear on podcasts. You might then take an action from a podcast such as
                        subscribing to a newsletter and once through the funnel you may do something more direct or share
                        with others and become loyal and advocate so podcasting can create so many opportunities and save
                        you lots of time.

                    <p>
                        Sustainability with growth of vodcasts what carbon intensity is, is it in the streaming vs the
                        creation of the content and given there is a larger engagement with audio will this grow for video?
                        Sustainability of video podcast depends on how you do it, so if are at home isn't as much as in a
                        studio with more cameras and a larger resolution of footage so being intentional about what you
                        record is important for sustainability and record for the edit to save carbon emissions. The rise of
                        video, it is only going to grow as people are creating so much content so need to think about your
                        goal and there is a case for creating more long-form media that is less frequent with more thought
                        of energy put into this also if your budget changes you can go from video to audio but can use a

                        goals so for audio could have more episodes, but consistency is important.

                        With a view to starting a video podcast with links to what they do they want to be able to sustain
                        the energy so would it be better to release one episode a month rather than two weeks, so is it
                        better to do it less often but better? You can see what people are searching about what you are
                        interested in and see what search terms are being looked for and batch record episodes as there is a
                        value to doing it all in one go so you can then have a bank of content to share and have specific
                        search terms to look for this but content can become old very quickly so could have episodes for a
                        month rather than a year and if releasing once a month then aren't releasing content as much as
                        people would like or could have a series that is released once per week or every two weeks so would
                        recommend lowest amount is not one per month but one every two weeks.

                        How important is episode structure? Podcasts may have a key thing or certain segment of a show works
                        well in a co-hosted format and segments can be useful but they aren't the most important but having
                        a format can help with a set rhythm about length from 20 minutes to half an hour so may end with a
                        specific question such as one word that nurture's your zest. People want to know how to do a certain
                        thing so it could be a persona and people like this and feel listened to when their question is
                        answered on a show so segments can be important so need to think about how you source those
                        segments.

                        What is Ashleigh's favourite podcast? The recent Atomicon podcast Don't Work Harder is really motivating
                        to them and podcasts about being on purpose with tips along with conspiracy theories and true crime.
                        You have to protect your energy when listening to content, you have to find what is right for you. 
                        There are so many podcasts now such as the TUI one that is going on holiday with celebrities or 
                        could be ones about groundwater flooding and soil and so many other different podcasts. The people 
                        from "I could murder a podcast" visited her studio which was exciting as they listened to this but 
                        one of other people who was there was a famous footballer who they didn't know in comparison.

                        Listening to long podcasts can be a struggle so how short or long would be recommended for a podcast? When
                        doing a single monologue is 15-20 minutes is the maximum and for interview is 25 - 40 minutes or
                        longer. It also depends on if you are teaching someone or introducing a topic which is important to
                        you then can do segments where people share something and how you would deal or answer this. You
                        want episodes to be short and snappy, so people don't lose interest and people have different needs
                        when they listen to a show. Keeping an episode short allows you to manage your energy better or can
                        do more episodes if in that headspace so doing what is right for you is the most important thing to
                        add value or help people for example.
