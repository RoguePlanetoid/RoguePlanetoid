                                    related platforms, along with related technology and so much more to help Keep Current, Keep Coding.

                                <h3>Welcome</h3>
                                <p>
                                    I'm Peter and welcome to the second episode of the RoguePlanetoid Podcast where I'll be talking about the Windows App SDK. Firstly, there's been many user interface
                                     platforms for developers supported by .NET starting back in 2001 when it was first released with Windows Forms, which is still supported in modern .NET today. 
                                     Windows Forms or WinForms allowed developers to create Windows applications using a WYSIWYG interface as well as being able to add controls and elements during runtime, 
                                     but it had its limitations so in 2006 brought Windows Presentation Foundation or WPF which introduced XAML which meant you could separate the UI design of an application 
                                     from the functionality and allowed for a Designer workflow using Microsoft Expression Blend and Developer Workflow with Microsoft Visual Studio. Silverlight followed 
                                     a year later which was a slimmed down version of WPF that ran in a browser using a plugin, the same technology would later power Windows Phone mobile applications. 
                                     Later for Windows 8 would also use XAML with .NET for the modern-UI style apps on that platform which let to the  Universal Windows Platform for Windows 10 that 
                                     supported Desktop, Mobile with Windows 10 Mobile along with devices such as Xbox and HoloLens. 
                                </p>
                                <h3>Windows App SDK</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Windows App SDK was a result in changes in strategy within Microsoft such as the end of the Windows 10 Mobile platform it was decided to bring together native Win32 
                                    development and Universal Windows Platform together in a process known as Project Reunion which resulted in the creation of the Windows App SDK using WinUI 3 and 
                                    would support Windows 10 1809 up to the latest version of Windows 11. .NET developers can also choose to use .NET MAUI, or .NET Multi-platform App UI which allows 
                                    .NET developers to target mobile for iOS and Android as well as Windows. Also, there are also third-party platforms that allow .NET developers to use their skills 
                                    which includes the Uno Platform which is based upon WinUI and Avalonia UI which is seen a spiritual successor to Windows Presentation Foundation. You can find out 
                                    more about Uno Platform at <a href="https://platform.uno" target="_blank">platform.uno</a> or Avalonia UI at <a href="https://avaloniaui.net" target="_blank">avaloniaui.net</a> or you can check out any links in the show notes.
                                </p>

                                    Windows App SDK is the platform for building native applications for later version of Windows 10 and Windows 11 and provides a unified set of APIs and tools to build 
                                    applications for Windows Desktop. Windows App SDK is not tied to operating system releases from Microsoft so it can and has been updated more frequently to add more 
                                    features as the Windows App SDK is continuously evolving to add more features along with adding a target platform for both .NET MAUI and React Native and Windows App SDK 
                                    supports both WinRT APIs along with the Native APIs within Windows, to learn more about the Windows App SDK visit 
                                    <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk" target="_blank">learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk</a> or you can check out the link in the show notes.

                                <p>
                                    Windows App SDK is always adding new features that developers can take advantage of in their applications, one up-coming feature includes Windows 11 Widgets, which are based 
                                    on the Adaptive Cards technology which is used for elements within Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Bot Framework, and other platforms. Widgets provide a new way for users to see 
                                    information from your app as well as interact with it from the Widgets Dashboard within Windows 11, these can be updated with information from an application. To learn more 
                                    about creating Widgets using the Windows App SDK you can visit <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/apps/develop/widgets/widget-providers" target="_blank">learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/apps/develop/widgets/widget-providers</a> 
                                    or to find out about Adaptive Cards which will allow you to try out and design any Widgets then you can visit at <a href="https://adaptivecards.io" target="_blank">adaptivecards.io</a> or check out any links in the show notes.

                                    Windows App SDK is something any developer can get started with today by following the tutorials for Windows App SDK on my website tutorialr.com which includes how to get 
                                    setup and started including what you'll need to install and beginning your first application with Windows App SDK. There are also examples showing basic features such as how 
                                    to display a dialog with a message, use the command bar to access functionality or take advantage of notifications such as badges on the application icon on the task tray or 
                                    how to display a toast notification. There are also many games such as a memory game, a dart board, a racing game and more. There are as of recording fifty Windows App SDK 
                                    tutorials added so far with even more to come, to find my tutorials for Windows App SDK visit <a href="https://tutorialr.com/tutorials/winappsdk" target="_blank">tutorialr.com/tutorials/winappsdk</a> or check out the link in the show notes.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Windows App SDK hopefully will be the way going forward for native Windows app development, it would be nice if it is also supported by other Microsoft platforms such as 
                                    HoloLens and Xbox as those are only supported with the Universal Windows Platform at the moment, so it would be good for developers to be able to target those platforms 
                                    with modern .NET, although as an alternative they would also be ideally targeted by .NET MAUI instead. Being able to use the latest features of Windows using the 
                                    Windows App SDK is a great selling point along with having access as many native APIs as possible, with more support for features coming in each release is really 
                                    great and hopefully will be supported for a long time as when developing applications it is important to make the right choice but for now to support the most 
                                    features on Windows that is the Windows App SDK but there is also the option to support cross-platform applications with third-party platforms such as Uno Platform 
                                    and Avalonia UI as well as .NET's own .NET MAUI which targets the feature set available on Windows too.  If you are a developer using Windows App SDK it would be 
                                    great to be able to hear from you and share projects using the Windows App SDK for example Apple recently released some brand-new applications such as 
                                    Apple Podcasts that use Windows App SDK. Of if you just want to know if Windows App SDK is for you then you can get in touch via Twitter
