                                    Welcome to episode sixteen of the RoguePlanetoid Podcast about Uno Platform. Uno Platform is an open-source platform for building native mobile, web, desktop and 
                                    embedded apps in a single codebase using C# and XAML. Previously on the RoguePlanetoid Podcast I have talked about XAML which allows developers to decouple the user 
                                    interface of an application from the implementation in code using Windows Presentation Foundation and Windows App SDK. I have also talked about .NET MAUI which is 
                                    Microsoft's own open-source platform for building native mobile and desktop applications in a single codebase. You can listen to those episodes about 
                                    <a href="../episode-fourteen/">XAML</a> and <a href="../episode-fifteen/">.NET MAUI</a> wherever you listen to your podcasts, or you can check out the links in the show notes.                                                
                                </p>
                                <h3>Uno Platform</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Uno Platform is a third-party open-source platform that allows developers to target applications using the latest .NET for Windows 10 and Windows 11 using C# and XAML with 
                                    WinUI 3, for modern browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari using WebAssembly, JavaScript, HTML 5, and CSS, for iOS and Mac Catalyst using AppKit 
                                    and UIKit along with for Android using Views. Developers can also target Linux, including embedded applications on Raspberry Pi with SKIA or for Windows 7 with 
                                    Windows Presentation Foundation and SKIA. Uno Platform allows developers to create applications with a cross-platform user interface with a concise declarative user 
                                    interface markup using modern XAML-centric syntax with support for Hot Reload to see changes in either Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code to applications while 
                                    they are running. Uno Platform also supports declarative C# markup allowing for both front-end and backend development using only C# all in one platform, which 
                                    also supports Hot Reload to see changes as you make them in either Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Uno Platform supports reactive programming which makes it easy to create asynchronous and event-based cross-platform applications where you can make state explicit 
                                    and immutable and designed to work with data binding. MVUX or Model, View, Update, Extended introduces the concept of unidirectional flow and immutability of data 
                                    leveraging the power of XAML and data binding and with MVUX it possible to choose between declarative and reactive style programming. Developers can maintain a clear 
                                    separation of concerns that decouples presentation, domain and data layers of applications and code generation eliminates repetitive boiler plate code to reduce 
                                    complexity when writing reactive applications. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Uno Extensions make common developer tasks quick and easy with reusable code blocks and extensions that are flexible and extendable to provide the best start possible 
                                    for building production-ready applications. Uno Extensions include Navigation to easily move between pages or open dialogs, Localisation for applications by declaring 
                                    each supported language and Authentication for users or to restrict access using a variety of authentication solutions. Uno Extensions are also available for Configuration, 
                                    Hosting and Dependency Injection for registering components or services and to access dependencies in applications along with HTTP for registering API endpoints, logging, 
                                    serialisation, and validation.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Uno Themes make it easy to implement Material Design from Google, Fluent Design from Microsoft, or Cupertino Style from Apple in your applications with only a few lines of 
                                    code. Developers can control the look and feel of their application for seamless design with easy-to-use layouts, styling, animations, and interactions. Uno Themes are ready 
                                    to handle light and dark modes where you can provide users an option to switch between them automatically and developers can also customise any colours needed for their 
                                    application. Developers can also customise the appearance of any XAML controls including brushes, fonts and more on a page, application, or control basis.
                                </p>

                                    Uno Platform allows developers to build applications using their favourite integrated development environment such as Visual Studio where developers can code, build, debug 
                                    and deploy a single-codebase multi-platform application. Visual Studio Code can be used to develop and debug mobile, web and desktop applications which can include a physical 
                                    device or emulator and developers using JetBrains Rider can also create applications using Uno Platform. If you want to develop applications using your favourite IDE using C# 
                                    or XAML for UI development and build cross platform applications, then you can get started with Uno Platform at <a href="https://platform.uno" target="_blank">platform.uno</a> or check out the link in the show notes.

                                <p>
                                    Uno Platform for Figma allows developers and designers to work together and easily go from a design in Figma to XAML or C# markup for development. Figma allows designers 
                                    to work together with developers to explore design possibilities, build prototypes or production software. Figma brings together powerful design tools with collaboration 
                                    where teams can iterate ideas along with capturing feedback in real-time. Figma allows for a single source of truth between design and development and combined with plugins 
                                    such as Uno Platform for Figma enables designers to seamlessly create applications using the Uno Material Toolkit for Figma, which allows for design consistency with 
                                    templates and components along with hundreds of icons. Designers using Uno Platform for Figma can with a single click export ready-to-deploy code for developers complete 
                                    with colour and font files. Uno Platform for Figma makes it easier for developers where you can use Dev Mode to translate designs into code faster and there's Visual Studio Code 
                                    integration where you can inspect designs and use code suggestions to speed up your application development. To try out Uno Platform for Figma visit

                                <p>
                                    Uno Platform is a third-party open-source platform for building native mobile, web, desktop, and embedded applications quickly with C# and XAML using the latest .NET to run 
                                    on all target platforms along with enabling control over the look-and-feel of applications. Uno Platform supports Fluent Design from Microsoft, Material Design from Google, 
                                    and Cupertino Design from Apple along with creating applications by designers or developers using Uno Platform for Figma. Uno Platform supports Windows 7, Windows 10, and 
                                    Windows 11, along with iOS, Mac Catalyst, Android, and Linux. Uno Platform also support modern browsers including Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari with 
                                    WebAssembly which includes the Uno Playground and Uno Gallery.

                                    I've spoken at events over the past few years with presentations about Uno Platform such as four years ago when I showed off ports of games to Uno Platform including a game 
                                    created for Surface Duo which was a dual-screen mobile device from Microsoft. Two years ago, I did an updated presentation covering some of the new things that had been added 
                                    to the platform such as the Uno Extensions and Uno Platform for Figma along with showing off a Pomodoro App for Uno Platform. That presentation about Uno Platform opened an 
                                    opportunity to speak as part of a community discussion session at Microsoft Build 2022 where I talked about my experience building that application, which was an amazing 
                                    opportunity that I would never have got without Uno Platform.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Uno Platform has evolved over the years to bring more features for developers along with designers to create amazing looking cross-platform applications using XAML and C# or 
                                    even exclusively with C#. Uno Platform continues to evolve and add new features along with keeping pace with the latest version of .NET. If you want to check out source code,
