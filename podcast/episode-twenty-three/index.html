                                <p>
                                    .NET Aspire helps developers through every step of the development journey, get started with open-source templates, build with service discovery and use the developer 
                                    dashboard with logs, metrics and traces. Developers can define the topology of their application using C# and you can run an application with a single command to get 
                                    things up and running locally or deploy to the cloud, all while not having to worry about hosts or ports you just define which resources you have and what they depend 
                                    on and all settings or connection details are injected automatically into applications. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    .NET Aspire has useful common functionality with the .NET Aspire Community Toolkit and there is also preview support for Azure Functions. .NET Aspire is already helping 
                                    teams within Microsoft develop quicker with Xbox using it to tighten their developer loop, or to aid a small team to rebuild Microsoft Copilot from scratch in just four 
                                    months with a third of the code but still achieving feature parity with the previous version of Microsoft Copilot. To find out more about .NET Aspire, the set of powerful 
                                    tools, templates and packages for building observable production ready apps then visit <a href="https://aka.ms/dotnet-aspire" target="_blank">aka.ms/dotnet-aspire</a>

                                <h3>.NET & AI</h3>
                                <p>
                                    .NET 9 helps infuse AI into applications with intelligent features such as AI tokenisers, Tensor and TensorPrimitives, support for .NET SDKs for vector databases and 
                                    server-sent event parser. Intelligent applications built on .NET not only include Microsoft Copilot but other AI experiences which can take advantage of a streamlined 
                                    set of unified APIs, Microsoft.Extensions.AI available in preview now, supporting common AI abstractions with standard middleware for interoperability and extensibility 
                                    to make it easier to integrate AI functionality into .NET applications.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Microsoft.Extensions.AI includes Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Abstractions providing essential abstractions for integrating AI services into .NET applications and libraries. 
                                    AI features are evolving with common patterns emerging such as chat, embeddings and tool calling so a set of unified abstractions are crucial for developers to work 
                                    effectively across different sources, such as consuming language models either locally or remotely so regardless of provider you can seamlessly integrate using these in .NET.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Microsoft.Extensions.AI supports common abstractions for AI services along with library authors who can implement these abstractions to make their clients interoperable with 
                                    the ecosystem. This allows developers to code against standard abstractions that can then pass through to specific APIs for AI services when required. Microsoft.Extensions.AI 
                                    in preview currently supports implementations for OpenAI, Azure AI Inference and Ollama, but with the expectation of more being supported by package authors to support other 
                                    AI services. Microsoft.Extensions.AI makes it easy to consume AI services and integrate them into .NET applications, which you can find including abstraction implementations 
                                    for OpenAI, Azure AI Inference and Ollama at <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.AI" target="_blank">nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.AI</a> or check out the link in the show notes.

                                    C# is the open-source programming language for building applications in .NET and with .NET 9 comes C# 13 which includes minor improvements and enhancements to make it easier 
                                    to use. C# 13 includes support for IEnumerable with params to allow developers to support collection items to be passed in as arguments which can also include Span or 
                                    ReadOnlySpan. Existing libraries can be enhanced with support for params such as these by adding an OverloadResolutionPriority attribute to make sure that the correct 
                                    overload is used in the library, there will be more work to make sure that spans become a first-class citizen in C# 14.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    C# 13 already supports partial methods which are mostly used by source generators to provide hooks for an implementation, but now you can have partial properties to create 
                                    the definition of a property using the existing auto property syntax, and then create the definition of the property using existing property syntax, although due to this 
                                    auto properties for just defining a partial property is not supported. Auto properties in C# 13 will finally be able to access the auto generated backing field with the 
                                    new field keyword, this feature is in preview and opt-in as it is a breaking change so there will be guidance around values called field already present in many codebases, 
                                    but a solution is to use this.field or @field and only when field is used on its own is this assumed to be the keyword for the backing field, developers will be able to 
                                    give feedback on this experience which will be fully introduced in C# 14.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    C# 13 supports a new lightweight System.Theading.Lock object which can be used with the existing lock keyword, but will have guardrails to make sure that the correct lock is 
                                    being used in certain situations that developers may encounter to indicate if the incorrect lock type may be used. C# 13 also supports ref structs, use by spans, for 
                                    generic scenarios where you can implement an interface but a ref struct cannot be converted an interface, this is done with the use of the allows ref struct, a so-called 
                                    anti-constraint to allow ref structs to be used implicitly in methods, to enable ref structs to take part in an abstraction, which is being enabled across .NET as first-class 
                                    support to allow for further functionality for ref structs in future versions of .NET. To find out more about C# then you can listen to <a href="../../podcast/episode-thirteen">Episode Thirteen</a>

                                <p>
                                    .NET 9 includes improvements and enhancements that .NET developers can leverage to create applications, including using .NET Aspire to make it easier to build observable, 
                                    reliable, scalable and manageable applications. Developers can infuse applications with AI using Microsoft.Extensions.AI, take advantage of free open-source toolkits and 
                                    community contributions to .NET MAUI, along with optimised asset handling, performance, memory management and more in ASP.NET Core and Blazor. .NET developers can also take 
                                    advantage of improvements and functionality in C# 13 delivered with .NET 9. For all the announcements and sessions covering all things new in .NET 9 along with presentations
