                                    I'm Peter and this is the RoguePlanetoid Podcast where you will find insights about Microsoft or related platforms and technology, along with so 
                                    much more whether you are beginner or an experienced professional or just interested in technology. Keep Current, Keep Coding!
                                </p>
                                <h3>Welcome</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Welcome to episode twenty-eight of the RoguePlanetoid Podcast about Microsoft Build 2025. Microsoft Build 2025 covered empowering AI with 
                                    interconnected agents and integrating AI capabilities into web, mobile or desktop applications. I'll be talking about core topics discussed during 
                                    the keynotes and from some of the sessions that you can watch along with others at <a href="https://build.microsoft.com" target="_blank">build.microsoft.com</a> or you can check out the link in the show notes.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Microsoft Build Opening</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, started Microsoft Build 2025 by saying that we are at the stage where things are happening and scaling to build out 
                                    the agentic web at scale and having the right tools to bring ideas to life. Microsoft are opening sourcing Copilot in Visual Studio Code as open source 
                                    is at the core of GitHub, which is the world's open developer platform, and continue to build out more capabilities including being able to assign a 
                                    task for an AI to execute. Sam Altman from OpenAI spoke about the various form factors that developers can use such as command line interfaces and 
                                    agents along with how developers can use different form factors together, and how OpenAI models will continue to evolve, get simpler to use and be 
                                    more reliable to build agentic applications including multi-agent orchestration.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Developer tools are getting richer and there are opportunities to work with Microsoft 365 and Copilot Studio to develop your own agents for AI 
                                    automation. Microsoft 365 can easily scale productivity solutions with Microsoft 365 Copilot by combining them with other services, connect multiple 
                                    agents and perform behaviour in a workflow, along with taking advantage of Copilot Tuning which is a low-code way of fine-tuning a model. Everything 
                                    underneath Copilot is a first-class platform to build your own applications and extensions to enable multi-modal applications that are production 
                                    ready. It takes more than a model to build a system, so Azure AI Foundry is the complete platform for the AI age, where you can choose from a variety 
                                    of models and integrate access to the real-time web and enterprise knowledge, along with providing the full spectrum of compute for agents including 
                                    Azure Container Apps or Azure Functions.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Microsoft are helping form the agentic web in an open way and there has been an explosion of agents with a richer ecosystem for them being built, 
                                    and they are being used more frequently than ever before. As agents become more sophisticated, they can perform more complex tasks including the 
                                    need for robust memory with high precision and recollection. Azure AI Foundry will become richer over time and what is important for the agentic 
                                    web is agents being able to take actions on your behalf, leveraging protocols such as Model Context Protocol or MCP and agents communicating with 
                                    each other using A2A. It is also possible to use a team of agents to make a scientific discovery by reasoning over knowledge, generating hypotheses 
                                    and conducing research that can leverage both publicly available research alongside internal knowledge. 
                                </p>
                                <h3>Unpacking the Tech</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Jay Parikh opened the second day's keynote by talking about the Core AI team he supports, which focuses on empowering every developer to share the 
                                    future with AI. It is possible to leverage AI tools such as GitHub Copilot by assigning tasks such as a GitHub issue to be completed, such as amending 
                                    a readme file or even implementing a design change for an icon. You can then see what GitHub Copilot has done about an issue on GitHub in a PR and you 
                                    can even comment to include additional information such as adding a diagram to a document. GitHub Copilot could even respond to an issue, such as 
                                    detecting when a problem occurs during a deployment to production that can be investigated, determine the cause was due to an error from the 
                                    deployment, performing a rollback and handle any monitoring afterwards - all without human intervention.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It will be possible to plan, create and operate workflows where you can have a team of AI agents you can work with, and you will need a platform 
                                    that powers these agents that will require new systems. Infrastructure and tools will be provided by Agent Factory which aims to take the same 
                                    approach that Microsoft was founded upon to create a software factory, to build a full-stack platform for AI agents and applications. Azure AI 
                                    Foundry will provide a complete stack of AI capabilities along with key services to expand including Agent service to scale agents at enterprise 
                                    scale, agent catalogue to select from existing agents and agent knowledge which allows agents to perform more sophisticated tasks, support tools 
                                    connected with Model Context Protocol or MCP and A2A to connect agents plus frameworks to help make decisions in a more cohesive way.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Agents can be developed using Azure AI Foundry and Visual Studio Code, which has an extension where you can see what agents are doing including 
                                    requests and responses along with details such as tokens used and tools that have been called, and you can also use multiple agents together in one 
                                    experience. These tools are important to shape our craft and team culture and to realise ambitions, but the opportunity is the idea of breaking free 
                                    of constraints and build in multiple dimensions and in parallel with multiple agents and work together to make superpowers ubiquitous where the 
                                    limitations are just imagination and drive. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Windows AI Foundry is a way to build AI models with the support needed to get started using models tuned for Windows that can span CPU, GPU or NPU, 
                                    that you can run directly on your PC and be easily integrated with a simple endpoint for local or hybrid scenarios that can leverage AI capabilities 
                                    in the cloud. Windows AI Foundry allows you to see which models are optimised for your PC or see which ones are already downloaded directly from a 
                                    command line interface which can be even used to interact with the model. Models can be customised with parameter efficient finetuning by providing 
                                    training and test data with LoRA, which is performed on Azure and provides a lightweight file that can be used locally and can even see what output 
                                    is like before and after using an adapter.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There will be lots of agents developed and Microsoft Copilot follows you from app to app, delivering capabilities across Microsoft 365 applications 
                                    including Microsoft Teams. There are many agents already available and the agents developers build can show up in an open ecosystem, a key part of 
                                    this is Model Context Protocol which is the new way these agents can communicate to back end systems and MCP services are available for anyone to use, 
                                    and Microsoft will support all the open protocols that matter as part of an open agentic web to create first class experiences in platforms such as 
                                    Microsoft Copilot.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Scott Guthrie closed the keynote talking about Microsoft offering the highest scale, lowest cost AI infrastructure that powers AI agents with 
                                    innovations and optimisations in Microsoft Azure, which has more regions than any other cloud provider and Microsoft are expanding capacity to bring 
                                    applications closer to customers. Much of the capacity in Azure is optimised for AI and Microsoft are building out new Azure AI Datacentres with the 
                                    most advanced AI super computers, to allow developers to leverage AI models at a lower cost that source energy from renewable or zero-carbon sources, 
                                    with Microsoft being on track to be 100% renewable energy by the end of 2025. Azure AI Datacentres also involve placing GPUs together in a single 
                                    rack to train larger AI models, but this requires liquid cooling but to save water continuous closed loop systems that leverage giant fans to disperse

                                <p>
                                    Keynotes are not the only part of Microsoft Build but are joined by numerous sessions which offer a deep dive into the concepts covered and more, 
                                    with the first session to highlight about Azure AI Foundry, the AI app and agent factory to bring AI into applications for developers taking ideas 
                                    to code then to production. Workflow for a podcast can have a bunch of toil that could be erased with agentic AI such as collecting bios for guests, 
                                    socials, show notes and copy for social media, which improves over doing this manually with potential for style drift or where reference and link 
                                    curation can be hard along with guest and topic metadata upkeep being challenging.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Azure AI Foundry has many models including foundational models delivering new choices and opportunities for developers, with unified access to models 
                                    that can be easily switched from a model catalogue and even use the Foundry Agent to help pick the correct model for your use case or use leaderboards 
                                    to see what are the best models based on benchmarks including quality versus cost, quality versus safety and quality versus throughput. Foundry Local 
                                    can be used to run AI models locally on your own hardware such as obtaining information online to produce a bio for a guest of a podcast episode. 
                                </p>

                                    Agents can take input such as system events, user messages and messages from other agents and then use a large language model, instructions or tools 
                                    which can make tool calls for retrieval, actions or memory and then output can be agent messages or tool results. Multi-agent orchestration means you 
                                    do not need to have a lot of functionality in a single agent but can create one that has specific functionality to be orchestrated together with other 
                                    agents. You can build agents your way with platform integrations for an agentic flow with code handling every detail using Azure AI Infrastructure 
                                    where you can also bring your own frameworks, leverage platform as a service using code, managed services using Azure AI Foundry and Foundry Agent 
                                    Service and software as a service with drag-and-drop UI using Copilot Studio which is the instant agent runtime.

                                    mental model and teach AI about the user. Design for co-creation including working with AI to help user's craft effective outcomes and support 
                                    co-editing of generated outputs. Design for imperfection by making uncertainty visible, evaluate outputs for quality and offer ways to improve 
                                    outputs along with providing feedback mechanisms. Microsoft's principles for AI are fairness, reliability and safety along with privacy and security 
                                    plus inclusiveness, transparency and accountability. Azure AI Foundry provides a broad selection of models and helpful tools to help guide choices.

                                    .NET MAUI is for building native multi-platform applications all in one framework with a single project and codebase that can support over sixty 
                                    common device APIs, or access platform specific APIs if needed. .NET MAUI offers one solution for everything you need with context awareness and 
                                    adaptive UI for a flexible UI that AI can manipulate. .NET MAUI can deliver hybrid applications which blend native and web technology that allow 
                                    access to native platform features and device hardware that web applications cannot easily access or at all. .NET MAUI hybrid applications with 
                                    Blazor are enabled with Blazor Web View including a solution template and tight inner loop for development with Copilot and Hot Reload. 
                                    .NET MAUI hybrid applications with JavaScript are enabled with Hybrid Web View and allow developers to reuse components from JavaScript frameworks 
                                    such as Angular or React plus in .NET 10 there will be new hooks for intercepting web requests.

                                    Agentic DevOps is evolving DevOps with AI powered agents operating as a member of your developer team to automate, optimise and accelerate every 
                                    stage of the software development lifecycle. GitHub Copilot is built for the developer experience to automate the mundane and focus on what matters, 
                                    and the next evolution of GitHub Copilot is new agents to help solve real-world problems including ideation, planning, model evaluation, assisted 
                                    coding, testing, code review, security, deployment and modernisation. GitHub Copilot agent mode supercharges the AI-assisted coding experience by 
                                    assigning multi-step coding tasks to leverage AI-powered peer programming that can build new features or refactor legacy code. GitHub Copilot Vision 
                                    allows you to illustrate your context with images to interpret UI designs from project architecture diagrams to napkin sketches. GitHub Copilot 
                                    Coding agent provides agentic capability in GitHub to enhance team productivity where can assign issues and get back pull requests but stay in 
                                    control just like with any developer by iterating through pull requests.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Windows App SDK & WinUI</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Finally, my last highlighted session was on crafting great Windows native app experiences. Windows App SDK and WinUI supports new MVVM Toolkit 
                                    generators to remove boilerplate code to help implement observable properties and commands, for MVVM scenarios with minimal code and Native AoT 
                                    allows you to publish your application using the native .NET AoT runtime for faster startup performance, lower memory usage, smaller binary size 
                                    and self-contained deployment. Windows App SDK introduces meta packaging so only need to include the subset of packages you need to minimise size 
                                    of self-contained applications and make them easier to use in Windows Presentation Foundation. Windows App SDK will have a new experimental release 
                                    cadence from quarterly to monthly releases to get the latest bits to developers as soon as possible.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Developers aren't usually designers, but you can elevate your application with core principles such as consistent spacing which uses units of four 
                                    and layout to create visual order, typography where clear text builds hierarchy with a really nice type ramp available plus colour and material can 
                                    help users by highlighting what matters, and motion to help users understand what is happening. Many core components in WinUI support Children 
                                    Transitions so when repositioned their movement looks better which can add up to an overall improved application experience. When listing 
                                    applications in the Microsoft Store there will be a Figma design template to see how your application icon will look in the store and in future 
                                    across Windows itself, and the same Figma template will also help with creating application screenshots that contain text and highlight parts of 
                                    your screenshots, which you can explore and use when publishing your application.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Fluent Design in both WinUI and Windows Presentation Foundation help make your application look great and applying core design principles can get 
                                    you a long way. Design helpers in WinUI Gallery and Windows Community Toolkit can be leveraged along with easy-to-use helpers to add polish to your 
                                    application, plus the app icon and screenshot templates for Figma can help create beautiful assets for your application to help make it stand out. 
                                    Microsoft Store reaches over 1.2 billion users with an open platform with flexible commerce for Win32, UWP and web applications and can be packaged 
                                    with any technology. There is a new zero-cost onboarding fee for individual developers so submitting application is now completely free, if you're 
                                    publishing Windows applications with MSIX then distributing them on the Microsoft Store is recommended, and Microsoft is making it easier for 
                                    people to discover applications.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Microsoft Build 2025 was another evolution in AI and platform technologies since Microsoft Build 2024, where agentic AI is now normal and Microsoft 
                                    is enabling developers to leverage the latest capabilities within their own agents, including creating agentic workflows with multiple agents or 
                                    integrating AI-powered functionality into their own applications. It was great to get an overview of everything new including announcements from 
                                    Microsoft during the keynotes, and you can read more about the Microsoft Build 2025 Keynotes in my article 
                                    at <a href="https://rogueplanetoid.com/articles/microsoft-build-2025-keynotes" target="_blank">rogueplanetoid.com/articles/microsoft-build-2025-keynotes</a>

                                    Microsoft Build 2025 featured informative sessions that would be too numerous to cover all of them but those highlighted showed how developers can 
                                    leverage models in the cloud with Azure AI Foundry, or on the client with Windows AI Foundry. Developers creating AI powered experiences can leverage 
                                    the power of enterprise data using SQL Server 2025, build or deploy scalable solutions with .NET Aspire, create advanced web services infused with 
                                    AI powered by .NET utilising Microsoft.Extensions.AI using ASP.NET Core with Blazor, .NET MAUI for mobile, desktop or hybrid applications along with 
                                    Windows applications using Windows App SDK and WinUI. Overall, it was great to see how things have evolved in the era of agentic AI to create 
                                    interconnected intelligent experiences, and you can read about the Microsoft Build 2025 Sessions I highlighted in my article
