                                    Spotify for Developers allows developers to create applications that work with Spotify along with documentation. Spotify for Developers provides a Web API where 
                                    you can amongst other things get metadata from Spotify content or control playback along with being able to try out endpoints directly from the documentation, 
                                    an Ads API that allows you to build, manage and get reports on Spotify Ad Studio campaigns and a Web Playback SDK that allows you to stream Spotify content 
                                    from inside web applications. iOS and Android Developers can take advantage of SDKs that allow your application to interact with the Spotify app running in 
                                    the background as a service or Web Developers can use Embeds to share interactive content from Spotify on a website they control. Commercial Hardware from 
                                    approved partners can take advantage of Spotify using the Spotify Embedded Software Development Kit to allow them to integrate Spotify into smart speakers 
                                    or other compatible devices to listen anywhere using Spotify Connect. Spotify for Developers also has Design guidelines to make sure integrations respect 
                                    the Spotify brand correctly or Accessibility guidelines to help make sure your applications are accessible to everyone along with a community with blog posts 
                                    and podcast episodes directly from Spotify along with being able to talk with the Spotify team and fellow developers on a discussion forum. To find out more

                                    Spotify for Developers Web Playback SDK is a JavaScript library that allows developers to create a player that can stream Spotify content from a web application within 
                                    a browser along with controlling and getting metadata of the current playback. Web Playback SDK is supported in most modern browsers on mobile and desktop and creates 
                                    a new player in Spotify Connect where you can play audio from Spotify within a web application. Documentation for the JavaScript Library is available that explains 
                                    all the features including being able to adjust volume, pause, resume, seek, skip to the previous item or next item being played and more. To get or find out more

                                    Spotify for Developers Embeds allow any web developer to add audio content to their own websites such as a podcast, album or other audio content that can be used to promote 
                                    new music, share latest podcast episodes or just share a favourite album or playlist. This can be as simple as copying a few lines of HTML from within the Spotify application 
                                    or developers can take advantage of an iFrame API to create web applications that dynamically load, play and pause content and an oEmbed API to allow a website to handle 
                                    Spotify links that have been shared by users. Embeds have full documentation available including tutorials and reference, you find this and more at

                                    Spotify for Developers Commercial Hardware supports devices that integrate Spotify's Embedded Software Development Kit available for approved partners wanting to create 
                                    devices that allow listeners to connect to their device with Spotify Connect. The Embedded SDK includes all the functionality needed to integrate Spotify Connect on a 
                                    device which could be a smart display, smart speaker or similar device which can then allow a user to transfer their playback to the device and they can control playback 
                                    on this device such as pause, skip, volume and more. To find out more about creating Commercial Hardware for Spotify with Spotify for Developers then

                                    Spotify for Developers Guidelines for Design and Accessibility are available to assist developers when creating their applications. Design guidelines help make it easier to 
                                    integrate Spotify content into an application while respecting their brand and any legal or licensing restrictions and ensure that users get the same experience regardless 
                                    of the platform, this includes how to use the Spotify logo, icon and colour schemes along with how to display content from Spotify and more. Accessibility guidelines help 
                                    create applications using Spotify regardless of the way they are used or how devices are interfaced with, including alt-text in images, colour contrast and more.

                                    Spotify for Developers isn't my first experience of using a music service API, as I've been working with them off and on for the past few years, first starting with Zune 
                                    from Microsoft which was their music service and hardware available at the time. Zune included the Zune Social which featured an embeddable flash-based widget known 
                                    as a Zune Card that included recent or favourite tracks and more. Zune Cards used XML data which as a developer I used to create an application in Silverlight called 
                                    ZuneCardr where you could export images of Zune Card data. I later repurposed this as a brand-new application that could display Zune Card information on Windows Phone 7 
                                    when that platform launched, without knowing this would be the only way you would be able to do that on Windows Phone 7, so the application proved very popular and 
                                    gained over 330,000 downloads during the lifetime of the Zune service being available. Not only did this application display the information from the flash-based Zune Card 
                                    but thanks to my investigation of Microsoft's undocumented Zune Marketplace API I was able to expand the capabilities of the application to allow full playback of music tracks, 
                                    enabled by the Zune Pass music subscription service that was also available at the time, this combined with the Zune Card information allowed the application to provide 
                                    features from the Zune service on the Windows Phone platform that Microsoft themselves never did. Zune was later replaced by Xbox Music but this time it not only had an 
                                    official API with full documentation but also had a .NET SDK. I was able to use this SDK create a new application that brought back the original features of my ZuneCardr 
                                    application to enable creation of images that could be shared of favourite tracks, albums and more from Xbox Music for Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile. 
                                    However, during development Groove Music replaced Xbox Music but this brought more features and an improved SDK, so I was able to make the application even better. 
                                    Groove Music itself however later also shut down, but there was to be no replacement this time from Microsoft and ended the era of music services from Microsoft and users 
                                    were directed to migrate over to Spotify, including myself. This is where my journey with Spotify began which picked up right where Zune, Xbox Music and Groove Music had 
                                    left off as all the music I wanted was also and I soon found they also had a music API via Spotify for Developers. One weekend I decided to take the Groove Music API and 
                                    got it working with the Spotify Web API from Spotify for Developers instead, which I later further refined into a brand-new .NET Standard package designed specifically 
                                    for the Spotify Web API called Spotify.NetStandard. I have continued to update and add new features to this package over the years and it has gained over 10,000 downloads, 
                                    it supports all features of the Spotify Web API either with a stream-lined multi-purpose or per-endpoint implementation and is supported by the latest version of .NET 
                                    or down-level to .NET Framework 4.8.1. Search for Spotify.NetStandard on NuGet or visit <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/Spotify.NetStandard" target="_blank">nuget.org/packages/Spotify.NetStandard</a> or get full source code along with
